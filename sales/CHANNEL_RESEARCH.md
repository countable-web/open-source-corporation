# Channel Research

## Purpose

Find where customers are

## Scope

Where to find initial sources of customers, and how to improve your list over time.

## Process

1. List all the places you could connect with customers and capture leads.
1. Include creative ways such as finding out who "knows" your customer, and who they pay attention to.
1. Sorty the channels that have the highest expected value (most qualified, numerous, valuable leads).
1. Test the top 5 channels by investing a few hours and/or a few hundred dollars.
1. Repeat the above step, slowly re-ordering your list based on the number of leads you actually get, and increasing the budget.
1. When you start getting sales, this can replace leads as the criterion to order your list.

You now have all the information you need to optimally invest your advertising budget.
