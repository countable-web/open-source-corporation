Purpose
-------

To identify a replicable process for filtering appropriate sales leads.

Scope
-----

Currently gives a basic overview and description of the filter mechanism we rate potential leads with.

Lead Filtering Basics
---------------------

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those
who believe in the same things as us. The following set of inquiries
outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and
clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articuate one of the following together? A problem,
   opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a
   big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you
   have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's
prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with
no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue
further work.

Filtering Proposals
-------------------

Record the RFP due date, organization and link in a spreadsheet, along
with its score as follows:

-  20 points if the RFP is in your niche of products and services.
   Partial points if the industry matches, but not the exact
   service/product (it's nearby).
-  10 points for tech match. Mention of any from: Django, Node,
   Postgres, Vue, React, javascript, web mapping, etc. Deduct points for
   .NET, SAP.
-  10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio
   value.
-  10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
-  10 points if Scrum or Agile is mentioned, partial (5) points if it
   the project is phased with a prototype.
-  20 points for contract size. 0 for $10k, 5 for $20k, 10 for $50k, 15
   for $100k, 20 for $200k and up, 15 for over $500k, 10 for over $1M.
-  10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the
   scoring.
-  BONUS points if it's an existing relationship, we can keep the IP for
   future use, or open source it, or some other circumstance.

50 points is the cut-off for moving on to PRE-QUALIFY
