Niche Experiments
=================

(draft)

Purpose
-------

A fundamental challenge in selling the value produced by a company is
market segmentation. Here we define some systematic tests to confirm
exactly who to optimize our products, services and market funnel for.

Scope
-----

How Countable explores new markets.

Criteria
--------

We want to choose the party that enables us to *deliver* the most value.
Finding such an ideal nice is riddled with uncertainty, including black
swans. All the following conditions must be met.

-  Creation of outsized value must be possible.
-  There must be a clear path (project) that can be executed with our
   resources.
-  We must be able to use a prototyping approach to create the value.
-  The project must be motivating to our team.
-  Legal needs must be satisfied. Is there a contract agreeable to all
   market participants?
-  All parties agree to how the value pie is sliced.

The great thing is, our company is built to deal with uncertainty. We do
this via prototyping. The analog in sales is to create "niche
experiments". That is, we set up a low cost sales funnel to test if all
the above conditions can be satisfied.

Process
-------

-  Identify the target market segment (persona). What are their problems
   and goals. Talk to at least one of them.
-  What problem can we solve for them, and what is it worth to them?
-  We proceed to unscalably contact one person in this market and
   validate all assumptions with them.
-  Make the sale, and give them a (small) deal to say thanks for their
   help.

If at any point, the next step can't be completed, the experiment isn't
finished and the market should not be invested in.
