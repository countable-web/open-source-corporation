   Purpose
   Scope

Steps for onboarding a client:

-  A contract must be signed with the client.
-  In the contract appendix A, our services should be summarized, along
   with any key opportunities we can help with.
-  The client's top business priorities should be summarized. Document
   any bottlenecks preventing growth.
-  Create a project in Trello, a Slack Channel, and any necessary code
   repositories.

Client Quotes
-------------

Clients may request a budget in an RFP, or a quote for a specific piece of work. Keep the following in mind:

  * Break the work down into about 1 day line items (8 hours), with appropriate level of detail. On larger projects, up to a week can be in a single line item.
  * Our minimum quotable amount is $3,000. Amounts below this should instead be approved via a simple email message or Trello ticket from someone authorized to approve the work.
  * Separate quotes or budgets to be completed at different phases and specify the order (priority).
  * The quote should provide a clear scope of functional specification, and list assumptions it is based on in order to simplify determining whether later changes are in scope or not.
  * Use `this template <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc_xjX-SnOvQ9QemLBrsYtPrBZISqT4H7qFw_Wkn3Co/edit#gid=0>`_.
  * The big caveat with providing a quote, is it affects the work outcome. It may help keep the team focused on what's promised in the quote, but also may prevent fixing problems we find along the way, or looking into opportunities because of the concern of scope creep. This may result in a substantial loss of competitive advantage so we'd encourage our clients to avoid using quotes most of the time. Instead, budget 25% of the original budget for a prototype to multiply your knowledge of the problem at hand, and the decide what to do. At this point the work will likely be much more clear and incremental.
