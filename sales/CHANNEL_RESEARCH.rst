Purpose
-------

Find where our customers are.

Scope
-----

Where to find initial sources of customers, and how to improve your list
over time.

Process
-------

1. List all the places you could connect with customers and capture
   leads.
2. Include creative ways such as finding out who "knows" your customer,
   and who they pay attention to.
3. Sorty the channels that have the highest expected value (most
   qualified, numerous, valuable leads).
4. Test the top 5 channels by investing a few hours and/or a few hundred
   dollars.
5. Repeat the above step, slowly re-ordering your list based on the
   number of leads you actually get, and increasing the budget.
6. When you start getting sales, this can replace leads as the criterion
   to order your list.

You now have all the information you need to optimally invest your
advertising budget.
