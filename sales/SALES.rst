Scope
-----

This root page serves to anchor the resources that are linked out to different documents in greater detail.

Sales Basics
------------

Customer Persona
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our B2B consulting business, we generally work best with:

-  Small to medium enterprise, or medium businesses, from 20 to 200
   employees.
-  10M to 100M revenue.
-  progressive, flexible and data oriented entrepreneurs.
-  A decent level of digital savvy is helpful to understand
   opportunties.
-  They may want to hire us for a skunkworks, or strategic project
   insulated from their organization's process.
-  They want help taking advantage of the latest web technology.
-  They're more interested in a longer term trusting partnership than a
   one-off project quote/contract.

Process
~~~~~~~

TODO: sourcing leads. 
TODO: qualifying leads. 
TODO: learn about their
challenges and determine if we can help. 
See `Discovery <DISCOVERY.rst>`__

Day to Day Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Talk to your clients every week at a minimum. If you've worked on
   something, ensure you show what you worked on, ask for feedback.
-  When communicating with clients, a functional link so they can test
   it is best. A short video demo is great, or just an email with
   screnshots is ok too.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

-  Improve at asking for referrals.
-  Develop some outbound process such as surveying prospective companies
   we'd like to work with on what solutions they want.

Research
~~~~~~~~

Some stats to keep in mind: There's a 2% close rate on the first "touch"
or contact with a customer. This raises to 80% after the 12th touch.
