Steps for onboarding a client:

   * A contract must be signed with the client.
   * In the contract appendix A, our services should be summarized, along with any key opportunities we can help with.
   * The client's top business priorities should be summarized. Document any bottlenecks preventing growth.
   * Create a project in Trello, a Slack Channel, and any necessary code repositories.
