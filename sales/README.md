# Sales

## Purpose
The chapter documents our approach to taking on new work so we curate a group of clients we love working with over time, and stay profitable.

### Customer Persona

For our B2B consulting business, we generally work best with:
   * Small to medium enterprise, or medium businesses, from 20 to 200 employees.
   * 10M to 100M revenue.
   * progressive, flexible and data oriented entrepreneurs.
   * A decent level of digital savvy is helpful to understand opportunties.
   * They may want to hire us for a skunkworks, or strategic project insulated from their organization's process.
   * They want help taking advantage of the latest web technology.
   * They're more interested in a longer term trusting partnership than a one-off project quote/contract.

### Process

TODO: sourcing leads.
TODO: qualifying leads.
TODO: learn about their challenges and determine if we can help. See [../product/DISCOVERY.md]

### Day to Day Practices
  * Talk to your clients every week at a minimum. If you've worked on something, ensure you show what you worked on, ask for feedback.
  * When communicating with clients, a functional link so they can test it is best. A short video demo is great, or just an email with screnshots is ok too.

### Roadmap
  * Improve at asking for referrals.
  * Develop some outbound process such as surveying prospective companies we'd like to work with on what solutions they want.

### Research

Some stats to keep in mind: There's a 2% close rate on the first "touch" or contact with a customer. This raises to 80% after the 12th touch.
