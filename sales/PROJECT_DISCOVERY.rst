Checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

Kick-off Meeting
----------------

For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or
over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these
critical questions.

-  What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list
   of the personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis
   or value proposition).
-  How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
-  What is the most important benefit you expect this project to provide
   to the user?
-  How will success be measured?
-  What is the impact hypothesis using the above metric? How many people
   will use the solution, and how does it impact their lives/jobs? How
   can that be maximized?
-  What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much
   detail as possible about that vision.
-  Who will we need to work with and in what capacity? (make a list)
   Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
-  What assets and access is required for the project and who will
   provide it, by when?
-  Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and
   team. What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
-  What are the first key deliverables, by whom, and by when, in order
   to accelerate the project?

User Experience Design (UX) Planning
------------------------------------

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above
answers to develop a `user experience
design <./USER_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md>`__ research plan.

For Branding and Visual Design Projects
---------------------------------------

-  Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are
   close to what they want.
-  Use the branding questionnaire.
-  If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual
   primitives if new ones needed.
-  Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
