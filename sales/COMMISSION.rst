Currently covers basics and proposal writing responsibilities.

Commission Basics
-----------------

Countable pays up to 15% commission to those who help schedule new work
for us (internal or external, referrals or proposals).

Commission is paid out upon receipt of payment from the associated
project.

Proposal Writing
----------------

Commission is divided as follows.

-  We pay 3% to whoever creates the outline checking grammar + spelling,
   copies content from related past proposals, coordinating deadline,
   and submitting. (admin)
-  We pay 3% to whoever is responsible for sending the qualifying
   questions, identifies the contributor team, and doing internal
   evaluation and review. (manager)
-  We pay 6% to the technical authors who develop the proposal content
   and artwork. (contributor team)
-  We pay 3% to whoever finds the proposal and suggests it to the team
   to write. If it's from a source we always follow, this amount is
   kept. (sourcer)
