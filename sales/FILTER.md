# Filtering Leads

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those who believe in the same things as us. The following
set of inquiries outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articuate one of the following together? A problem, opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue further work.

# Filtering Proposals

Record the RFP due date, organization and link in a spreadsheet, along with its score as follows:

  * 20 points if the RFP is in your niche of products and services. Partial points if the industry matches, but not the exact service/product (it's nearby).
  * 10 points for tech match. Mention of any from: Django, Node, Postgres, Vue, React, javascript, web mapping, etc.
  * 10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio value.
  * 10 points if scoring criteria are provided.
  * 10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the scoring.
  * 10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
  * 10 points if Scrum is mentioned, partial (5) points if it the project is phased with a prototype.
  * 20 points for contract size. 0 for $10k, 5 for $20k, 10 for $50k, 15 for $100k, 20 for $200k and up, 15 for over $500k, 10 for over $1M.
  * BONUS points if it's an existing relationship, we can keep the IP for future use, or open source it, or some other circumstance.

60 points is the cut-off.
