# Estimation

# Purpose

Software project cost estimation is [notoriously difficult](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html). A typical problem is the team appears to have 70% of the information when estimating a project, when they really have 30% because by definition, they can't see black swan conditions (unknown unknowns).

# Scope

Define our approach and guidelines for software project cost estimation.

# Effort Estimation Process

For all projects:
  * Make sure you summarize the purpose of the work at the top of any estimation document.
  * Tell the client what you need by when to finish within the budget (data, access, creds).
  * Determine their deadline, and build a prototype that captures the general idea of the system within 25% of the alloted time.
  
# Quoting

Some companies require a quote in order to issue a purchase order. This is appropriate when:
  * The amount is at least $5,000.
  * The work is very well understood. We've done something very similar before, and understand the steps clearly.
  
A template is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IJtCsBL-rHwEkd0tcScvZM3IO5Auq3BLQeJSMywc8k/edit?usp=sharing). To fill it:
  * Fill in 1 to 5 days of effort per line item. Don't separate items which are under a day, batch them.
  * Each line item should be for a different team member. To get the day rate, multiply that person's standard hourly rate by 8 hours. The standard hourly rate (as with other agencies) is around 2.5 times the team member's hourly salary, although this varies. You can get the hourly rate from our accounting team.
  
## Billing

We have several models depending on what works for a client. Two most common / preferred:
1. Write a spec and give a quote. Estimate the number of days each work item will take. When it's approved, put the tasks from the spec in your Scrum Backlog. Whenever something new is added, it pushes down off bottom of the backlog (into the Ideas column ideally) and we explain to the client those items won't be done since we're doing their new request instead.
2. With other clients, we have a backlog and a retainer, so we try to work on the backlog a certain # of hours per week and use the Sprint meeting to ensure they're happy with progress for what they're paying.

## Sprint Meeting Schedule
  * If there's over 40 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting every week.
  * If there's at least 20 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting every 2 weeks.
  * If there's at least 10 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting once per month.

## Lead Time
  * We normally want 1 week of lead time to deliver items up to 2 days of effort. For larger items, we want a week lead time before starting, and deadlines will be managed via agile process (no hard deadline for specific scope, only identify launch dates and other notable dates with desired stories to be filled by then, the team can then focus on delivering the user stories as quickly and well as possible).
  
## Minimum Billable Amount
  * Any additional request (ie, via email) for technical work (anything not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of small requests since it's much less efficient that way.

## During the Project

  * During the project, if we expect to exceed the budget, tell the client and your manager ASAP, and explain what happened.
  * If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we also often finish early which balances out. If it happens a lot and can't be solved by communication, the client is a bad fit forus, and we shouldn't be working with them. Inability to communicate on budgets is a useful way to identify a bad client relationship.
