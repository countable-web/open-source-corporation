# Staff Feedback

If you're not sure where to add your thoughts, put them here. TODO: Move this stuff to reddit.com/countableweb

Captured feedback from employees on how we can improve. Discuss these in team meetings.

1. Better requirements clarity. - _being addressed by Scrum_
2. Allocate resources to train new staff. - _Survey on what training is desired at this point? On Reddit?_
3. Implement some engineering as marketing projects. - __
4. Sometimes I wish we had more documentation regarding each project, something stating the project's scope, deadlines, contacts, useful links (to the project or client's website), list of emails (stakeholders), that kind of stuff. I usually have to take notes right after a meeting so I won't forget what we discussed.
5. Clearer goals (OKRs)
6. Keep tone respectful / in dialog. Don't create negative tension in meetings and leave it unresolved.
7. task assignment that can be done asynchronously outside of a meeting.
8. In my opinion we must open EVERY meeting with last week reports over our KPIs. It shouldnt be an option since we feel that progress is being made
