Hi!

`cta (call to action) here "let's chat"`

Want to be challenged by a team who will push you to your potential, and support you along the way? If so, we may be the place for you.

We are technology consultants and product creators who love to prototype and experiment on the web. Our roster of happy clients includes the Tesla of boats, a star-trak grade medical devices startup, global comicbook brand, and a next generation of cellular data provider. We help socially responsible, driven, and lucky companies across the globe get their piece of the internet, whatever form that may take. It involves creating amazing things in an environment of your own design. We want you to help us envision and shape the company. Every voice matters and we want to find ways to always improve, push each other to our potential, and be the best solution for our users. We're also ridiculously transparent from the ground up: we've open-sourced our company's operations manual here if you want to learn more about our current thinking.

`responsibilities and skills`

You should:
  * You're willing to push yourself to reach the top of your field, and make an impact. We agree with Amazon's philosophy of "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at [Countable] you can’t choose two out of three."
  * You want to be part of our mission to empower creators on the web.
  * As this is a remote job, you need to have a suitable workspace available at home, with fast internet suitable for working all day. If you don't, there should be a local work co-op or other location you can work from nearby.
  * Be a continuous, self-motivated learner, and take initiative to improve the environment for yourself and your team members based on quarterly objectives.
  * Experiment with great focus, but know when to investigate a problem deeper yourself, when to ask your team for help.
  * Voice disagreements rather than keeping them to yourself. We need all opinions need to be on the table if they're to be taken into account.
  * *Clouds and Dirt* - Consider both the big picture and minute details, from a client's overall business down to crossing T's and dotting I's.
  * Have excellent written English skills.
  * Be able to determine, and focus on, what's really important in a complex environment with many distractions.

Here's a guide to determining if you're a good fit. If these things don't resonate with you, please don't apply. Our screening process will determine you're not a good fit so applying would be a waste of everyone's time. https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/recruiting/FIT.md

We are open to a variety of work arrangements and time commitments, let us know what you prefer.

Your application must include a resume, and a cover letter. To avoid automated submissions, and to see if you pay attention to detail and follow instructions, your cover letter must have exactly 100 words explaining your back story, and exactly 100 words about your first impression of Countable, and a question about us. I hope you're interested in being part of our mission (see documentation link above). If you help achieve it, there are stock and cash bonuses available.

I look forward to hearing from you!
