Front End Developer and Designer

``cta``

If you love CSS and HTML (and maybe some javascript and design), let's
chat!

``responsibilities and skills``

Make all our user interfaces look good and be painfully easy to use :)

You will be responsible for:

1. Designs, html, css and javascript for internal projects.
2. Precision and attention to detail in your designs.
3. Excellent code quality and standards.
4. Working on improving our front end work delivery pipeline by finding
   ways to improve and automate.

You should have a portfolio that demonstrates most if not all of:

1. CSS and HTML
2. UI Design in Photoshop, Sketch or other tools for front end mockups.
3. javascript
4. UX / Usability testing and communication.

There will be a technical test on the above skills, so it will save
everyone time if you're honest about your abilities.

Experience with Node.js, Python, Postgres (SQL) and Linux are also an
asset.

``test``

Design a UI mockup for (something TBD), convert to responsive html/css,
publish on github pages. If you know Node.js or Python, build a backend
rest api for the app as well.
