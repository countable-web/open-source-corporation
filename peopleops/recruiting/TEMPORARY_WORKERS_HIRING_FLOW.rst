=============================

This is a suggested hiring flow to make your life easier and standardize
our process while recruiting temporary staff. On this case, I'm using
Upwork platform to accomplish this goal, but you can adapt this system
according to your needs.

Pre-requisites tools
--------------------

1) Download Upwork app to receive instant notifications from potential
   leads when they answer to your offer. It's an important step because
   most freelancers are in different timezones, so you'll have a huge
   gap in communication if you don't respond to them right away.

2) Use a timezone conversion system like `Savvy
   Time <https://savvytime.com/converter/pdt-to-ist>`__, to schedule the
   meetings that should occur after the initial screening.

3) Use any video-chat service, like
   `Appear.in <http://appear.in/countable>`__ to schedule an interview
   with your best candidates.

4) You can check for more tools at our `peopleops
   folder <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HY7LPI_h5F5WxaTW5v-1_DMUXcJIjjh1>`__

Initial Screening
-----------------

1) Create an account at **Upwork** and click on the CTA "Post a Job" to
   create a post according to your needs. Make sure you include all
   relevant keywords in your new ad since it will improve your lead
   capturing.

2) Once it's created, check it by clicking at the navbar: JOBS > MY
   JOBS. It will appear at "My Postings" section, where you can see how
   many proposals you received and how many people messaged you.

3) After some time you'd receive your first leads if you've set your job
   post correctly.

   -  If not, delete it and create another, making sure you're entering
      relevant keywords to it. If you're unsure about the job
      requirements, ask your supervisor's assistance.

4) At "REVIEW PROPOSALS" step, click on "Filters". Now you should
   **shortlist**\ (click on the thumbs-up icon) the candidates that pass
   the following suggested minimum criteria:

-  Earned amount > 10k
-  Job success > 90%
-  Hours billed: 100+
-  English level: conversational
-  Talent type: freelancers & agencies

5) Now send a message to the selected ones, asking for a quick (15 min)
   video chat interview. Check what timezone he's in, and use a `time
   zone conversion tool <https://savvytime.com/converter/pdt-to-ist>`__
   to make sure it will match yours.

6) It's important to remember scheduling the interview time in an Alarm
   app (any app that remembers you about it) since once you get 2+
   interviews on the same day, you'll have a hard time trying to
   remember when exactly did you scheduled what meeting. Be careful to
   not confusing timezones!

Scheduling
----------

-  Please use `Calendly <https://calendly.com/>`__ to schedule your
   meetings and avoid timezone issues.

Interviewing
------------

-  Prepare yourself to the interview. Take a look at our standard
   `interview
   questions <https://docs.google.com/document/d/130KCrw5WGYTGgJYKBVec3iEXxKkNoEkm1urHzEWznMo/edit#heading=h.7h8atrac1axk>`__
   and pick the ones that you find relevant for the situation

-  Communicate your supervisor about the scheduled meetings, since he
   should participate as well.

-  On this step you and your selected candidate should join a video-chat
   meeting room, so you can have a quick conversation and get non-verbal
   cues about the lead personality traits, values, etc.

-  `Here's a link to countable's video-chat
   room <http://appear.in/countable>`__

Tests
-----

-  Try to use our internal technical test, if possible.

Options
~~~~~~~

1) A small test to deliver at a pre-determined date. (For example, build
   the application XYZ with the following features until a certain date)

2) For developers, one suggestion would be services like (we still
   exploring options):

   2.1) `https://www.hackerrank.com <https://www.hackerrank.com>`__

Contract signature
------------------

-  Once selected a candidate, your supervisor should proceed with the
   contract signature by using a `HelloSign <https://hellosign.com>`__
   template, that provides legally binding electronic signatures.

-  Once everything is prepared at HelloSign, send the document to the
   signature to your candidate's email.

-  Once your contract is signed, ask your **candidate national ID
   document**.

-  Confirm if the provided document name matches with what was inserted
   into the contract.

Onboarding
~~~~~~~~~~

-  After you've successfully completed the previous step and collected
   the candidate documents (save it at our `peopleops
   folder <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HY7LPI_h5F5WxaTW5v-1_DMUXcJIjjh1>`__
   or send it to your supervisor)

-  You should add the candidate to the following services:

   -  Project's Trello board
   -  Slack (Ask your supervisor to add him, to avoid privacy issues)
   -  Bitbucket
   -  Google Drive folder
