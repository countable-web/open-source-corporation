# Straw Polls

This process is important because it lets us gauge whats important to the team while increasing buy-in on each action we take to improve.
The goal is to find the changes that will move us towards our mission most quickly.

Create a survey on slack #general using emoticon reaction. Provide 8 "straw man" suggestions that have been in the ideas section of our "Company Building" Trello board.

Script:

@channel there are a ton of things we can choose to work on internally (many in the Systems board in Trello).
We want to find the ones that will move us towards accomplishng our mission fastest.
However, we can't do everything so here's a list. Your job is to make regular yellow ciricle emoticon to show how you feel
about each, I will exemplify. Also everyone please suggest the top thing you think we need to address that's NOT in this list.
Put an emoticon under 9 then. :smile_cat: or :smile: or :grin: or :simple_smile:, in order of how much you support it,
high to low. Or use any emote that fits, like :partyparrot: if you're so excited that you have to.
Please react to max 5 of these. Please consider the items added by other team mates below this as well. (edited)


Any items with 25% or more of the team supporting it should be moved into Trello "Company Design" Board requests for discussion on how to implement. Mention all those who voted for the item, in the card. Add the "staff pick" label to the card.

Items with 2 or more votes can be discussed briefly with the voters on how they'd approach it and have them articulate it better. If there's a quick fix, go ahead.
