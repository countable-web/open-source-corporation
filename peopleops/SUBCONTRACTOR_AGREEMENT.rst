Purpose

Transparently share our work agreement.

Scope
-----

TODO: This document is out of date and the official one has not been
converted to markdown and open-sourced.

This is the agreement template we hold with everyone who works at the
firm.

Term
----

-  This agreement may be terminated by either party at any time.
   However, it's courtesy to give 2 weeks of notice if the contract has
   held for at least 3 months consecutively.
-  Nature of relationship - Because it's a contract position, you are
   not an employee but instead a business associate, no payroll
   deductions are made. You are responsible for remitting income taxes
   and other deductions to the appropriate governing bodies.

Compensation and Expenses
-------------------------

-  Compensation - You will be paid an hourly rate for hours worked and
   recorded, with payment for each calendar month sent to you within one
   week of the following calendar month. The expectation is you will
   work a predefined number of hours per week starting when this
   agreement commences or a specified start date.
-  Leave - There is no paid vacation time. However, unpaid leave may be
   taken as long as communicated 2 weeks in advance.
-  Benefits - The typical employment benefits do not apply between the
   subcontractor and firm. The rate negoatiated should be increased
   accordingly to account for this. Please note that if you purchase any
   of these services yourself (such as extended medical benefits), they
   may be deducted from your taxable income.
-  Claimed Expenses - Business expenses (travel, conferences) approved
   in advance by a Partner are paid along with your regular
   compensation.
-  Unclaimed Expenses - Business expenses not claimed (Food and drink,
   home office, computers) may be deducted on your tax return.
-  Equipment and Office - You will provide your own equipment and office
   space. A Linux laptop or workstation is recommended; Mac OS also
   works; Windows, less so.

Other
-----

-  Confidentiality - You agree to hold in confidence and not to disclose
   to an outside party, any data you were given access to by Countable
   or parties who hold a business relationship with Countable, unless
   given explicit permission by the owner of said data, and for a period
   of 5 years after the termination of this agreement. In the event of a
   more strict confidentiality contract is held between Countable and
   the Client on a specific project, you will be required to agree to
   additional terms before engaging with that Client.
-  Non-compete and non-solicitation - You agree not to enter into an
   employment or paid contract relationship with Countable's Clients or
   other of Countable's subcontractors or employees, for a period of 6
   months of the termination of this agreement.

Discussion
----------

The fact you're not an employee is a bit strange but it has a lot of
advantages. In a way it's more like joining an exclusive "guild" than
being an employee. As questions arise I'll post explanations here so
this page improves over time.
