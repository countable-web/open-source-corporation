Giving Feedback
===============

Purpose
-------

Our team must provide each other with feedback regularly in order to
improve. Some references on why this is:

-  When a thoughtful dissenting opinion is introduced to a discussion,
   it quadruples the chance of the group finding the best answer (study
   cited in Originals, book)
-  Feedback from peers is the most effective way to grow professionally.
   (Originals)
-  Honest feedback prevents the perils of "group think" that damages
   teams as they grow. (Culture code)
-  `Gratitude makes you
   happier <https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier>`__

When to give feedback
---------------------

-  `Code reviews <../../product/engineering/GIT.md>`__. The benefits of
   Senior developers reviewing Junior developers' code is obvious I
   hope, but it's just as critical to provide feedback as a Jr
   devÂ because (1) you can learn much faster by reading others' code,
   and asking questions. (2) your questions will help Sr devs make their
   work more understandable. (3) it motivates Sr devs to have someone
   learning from them and seeing their work in general. (4) you can help
   other Jr devs learn. (5) It forces you to understand our standards
   and apply them better if you have to measure other people's work
   against them (6) Sr devs still make of mistakes
-  Peer reviews of UX and Art assets. Ask our team members to share XD
   links, screenshots your work on slack, and give them feedback in
   comments in XD, or right on Slack.
-  When there's a new release, review the stage site for your product.
-  Post a video of using a new product or UI, for the creator to see in
   that project channel.
-  Just PM (Private Message) someone on slack with your thoughts. Ask
   questions, state exact observations, and say how you feel about them.
   (See below, Guidelines)
-  Use the #thanks channel to show appreciation and gratitude. A ton of
   `evidence <https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier>`__
   suggests this makes you, the recipient, and the whole team happier.

Guidelines
----------

-  Ask your team for feedback. Make it easy for them by sharing a link,
   getting a code review, making a little demo video of what you did, or
   just asking a specific question "What could I improve in my fireball
   casting technique?".
-  When someone does something you like, let them know! That's how we
   get them to do it more. Positive feedback is *easy* to give, everyone
   feels good!
-  Remember the purpose of feedback. We have a team so we can help each
   other improve.
-  Keep it simple and clear. Mention the most important facts
   (observations) to avoid overwhelming the recipient. Small bits of
   frequent feedback are better than a huge essay.
-  It's not about who's right. The process of talking about performance
   and how do things improves everyone's work and helps us work together
   constructively. So don't stress. If you can give and receive feedback
   respectfully we've already won at this no matter what that leads to.

Negative Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Giving negative feedback can be hard, as we don't want to offend. The
problem is often that people just say "I don't like when you cast green
fireballs." with no explanation. Instead: "When you cast green fireballs
I'm concerned that it makes too much smoke. I've seen this reddit post
about it."

-  Make it clear the goal is to improve the work, and you're giving
   feedback because our team has high expectations, but you think the
   other person can meet them.
-  Be very respectful, constructive, helpful, humble and never mean or
   demeaning.
-  it's ok to be blunt. If you do have evidence of what the problem is,
   be very specific. It's not about your opinion, it's about the facts,
   you're just pointing out evidence.
-  It's also ok to be subtle. Especially if you're not sure what the
   problem is, try being subtle first. Pause to show you're thinking and
   then ask "Does that really work?" "I never thought of doing it that
   way, do you prefer it to my way?". When you question something out of
   genuine curiousity, the person will stop and do the same, without
   being offended. They may not change the behaviour right away but it
   helps more than you think.
-  It often helps to be clear about the actual problem. "I'm concerned
   that if we cast green fireballs, it causes too much pollution." This
   invites them to dismiss you of course, but it will stick in their
   mind.
-  Sometimes it helps to suggest an alternative but stick to the facts.
   "I use blue fireballs because it seems like it saves the environment,
   have you tried it?"

Receiving Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  It's hard for others to give you feedback, and it's precious. Don't
   bite. You don't have to agree, you just have to listen.
-  Don't interrupt, dismiss, or show impatience or offence. Show
   appreciation for them putting themselves out there to help you
   improve.
-  Paraphrase in your own words. "It sounds like you're saying blue
   fireballs produce less harmful carbon, but defeat just as many
   goblins."
