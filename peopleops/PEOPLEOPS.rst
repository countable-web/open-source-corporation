Purpose
-------

The purpose of this section is to make Countable a great place to work!

Scope
-----

This covers onboarding to Countable, and links out to all the People Ops resource pages.

Onboarding
----------

-  Go through each step of `the onboarding guide <ONBOARDING_GUIDE.rst>`__

Hiring
------

-  Countable does not take into account, race and gender in hiring
   decisions or salary offers. Hiring should be done as if these
   attributes are not known at the time of offer.
-  We use `this <./recruiting/BASE_JOB_POSTING.rst>`__ job posting.
-  We try to be always hiring, in order to snap up the right person if
   they come along at any time.
