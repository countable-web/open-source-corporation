Purpose
-------

Provide a consistent workflow checklist for Countable team members to refer back to.

Scope
-----

Covers mostly things we should already be doing. If it's something
we're still working towards, it's in *italics*.

Meetings
--------

-  Be on time, or notify as early as possible about absence or lateness
   and offer something instead (here's my summary so you can read it).
   See Commitments, below.
-  *Everyone should share something. Prepare what you want to say (that
   fits the meeting agenda), and even send it to team members before the
   meeting.*
-  If you have a proposal or idea, write it up in detail, and share it
   ahead of time. Indicate how it impacts something we care about (OKR).

Commitments
-----------

-  Be clear and specific about commitments. Say "I'll send you a
   prototype link at 2pm" rather than "I'll be done after lunch". *This
   should be in writing, such as in a Trello ticket (in this case, set a
   deadline on the ticket too.)*
-  If you're not going to meet a commitment, tell the team as early as
   possible, and explain what the gap will be, and how close you are.
   Explain what else you can do to help.

Every Day You Work
------------------

-  Share something with the team every day. The simplest way to do this
   is to report what you did on Slack in your team's channel, and
   anything you're stuck on. Shooting a quick `screen cap video <>`__ to
   share is a great idea to try out.
-  Check slack twice a day at least, and react/respond to some other
   team members' posts.
-  Commit your code and push it to bitbucket every day.
-  Fill your timesheet (end of the day)
-  Check your company Email

Every Week
----------

-  Communicate with each client you are working with. Send them an
   update on what's done and what's pending out of their current
   expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or
   video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday.

Do Not
------

-  Use priviate messages for things that don't need to be private. Share
   your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if it's
   more widely applicable, (#client-) in #general.
