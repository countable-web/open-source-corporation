# Diversity and Inclusion

Purpose: To approach our differences in a respectful and positive way and focus on building a shared culture based on empathy and common goals.

1. Countable does not tolerate non-meritocratic bias. We respect and support everyone the same, regardless of race, gender, religion or other attributes not related to our work. This also means there is as a general rule no special provisions made for these groups except to prevent, and to eliminate specific cases of, biases.
2. Don't conflate ignorance and malice. It's the responsibility of minority groups coach the team on what's considered respectful, and it's the team's responsibility to listen and make an effort to be culturally respectful.
3. If any team member is aware of disrespectful conduct, it must be reported. A manager will issue a warning the first time, and if it recurs, immediate dismissal. The warning must be made public to the team so everyone can see what happened, worded in a way that doesn't intrude on the victim's privacy (the aggressor's privacy is not an issue here).
4. It's the managerâ€™s responsibility to create an environment where the victim feels safe and comfortable enough to speak up. Any victim is protected by the company against any retribution for speaking up and is celebrated for their bravery in doing so. Please do speak up so we can solve the problem for everyone.
5. This policy is NOT intended to discourage negative feedback on our work. Negative professional feedback, offered with empathy and from your professional peers is one of the fastest professional development tools.
6. Countable acknowledges that gender bias is sadly still prevalent in the technology industry in particular. Our goal is to lead by example in creating a safe and supportive environment for women (and everyone else of course) to work.
