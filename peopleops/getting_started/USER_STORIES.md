# User Stories


## Purpose 
To describe the business goals of the project, and the features and functionality its product must include to be considered "complete."

## Scope
Use the following process as a template for user stories documentation.

## Process
The User Stories document should be created after the process of [Project Discovery](product/DISCOVERY.md) has progressed to the stage that we are discussing real, tangible possibilities for a project to deliver. 

"User Stories" should be readable by any project stakeholder of any skill set, and they should be regularly updated accordingly when client feedback or user testing leads to potential changes. If you are new to this concept overall, the [User story Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) provides some great beginning resources.

## Personas
Who uses the product (software you are developing in the project)? List them and determine their roles within context.

## Epics
Make a list of stories (in groups called Epics) that explain how the user uses the product and why, i.e.:

(PERSONA) needs to (ACTION) so they can accomplish (GOAL).

## User Acceptance Tests (UATs)
User Acceptance Tests, usually denoted in User Stories as UATs, comprise a listing of the technical requirements that must be met within the project to meet the User Story requirements. Generally, it's useful to list all of these below the related Epics, and strikethrough tasks as the team accomplishes them and they're approved by clients and project leads.
