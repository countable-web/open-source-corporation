## Should You Incorporate?

This section is only if you're in Canada for now.

1. If you're working full time, it's likely worth it, otherwise probably not.
2. It costs $400ish to incorporate (form a CCPC), plus $40/yr. You also need to spend a day or so on extra book keeping, and a day doing an extra tax return each year. You'll likely want to pay an accountant $1000 to do the return for you, or get corporate tax software for $150 or up. **The real cost is something like $2000 per year when you start.**
3. The main tax benefit is you can defer income to another year to stay in a lower tax bracket. The corporate tax rate for small businesses is only about 15%, so if you want to save money for several years it's likely a good idea to leave that portion in your corporation rather than pay the 45% tax rate. If you're going to save the money for quite a while, fill up your RRSPs first. Then start saving it in your CCPC.
