# Professional Development

## Training

We have official training materials [here](../../product/engineering/TRAINING.md). Bill for your time doing any of these.

## Books

If you buy a book for work, the company will reimburse you. [Suggested reading](../../REFERENCES.md) that's influenced our culture and methods.

## Monthly "Guild" Meetings

Each month we hold a meeting for any technical specialty the team is interested in. Currently there's a developer guild meet and a design/ux guild meet.
