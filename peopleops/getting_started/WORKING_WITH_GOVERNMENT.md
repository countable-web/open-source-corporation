Here is a high-level summary of requirements when working in the public sector.

When working for the Ministry of the Attorney General:

  * Do not make public announcements of unreleased work in progress (post to instagram, etc) without approval.
  * Observe our IT Security Policy.
  * Do not promote the Province of BC being our customer in marketing materials (promotional purposes) without prior written consent.
  * You need to go through a process for accessing protected information from the Province, including a criminal background check.
  * We cannot have a terms of use agreement with anyone regarding the work we produce for the Province (6.7, SI Contract).
  * Do not use production data in development, test or training environments without consent from the Province.
  * Use CloudFlare infront of all services deployed, as it provides various security requirements.
  * Automatic security patching must be enabled on all production servers.
  * Use GitHub's CVE detection system and patch any detected vulnerabilities prior to launch (use a CD gate).
