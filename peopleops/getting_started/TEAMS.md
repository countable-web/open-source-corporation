# Teams

## Purpose

Define what teams exist (and don't exist) at countable.

## Cross-Functional Teams
We have cross-functional teams organized by Objective. For example, we have a `bawkbox` team whose top level objective is to make it easy for any website to install any 3rd party widget. With each of our clients, we form a team with some of our staff. Countable does not have functional team divisions by job role.

## Other Informal Groups
On some occasions other groups may organize for professional development or other purposes. These are not `teams` in our company's terminology.
