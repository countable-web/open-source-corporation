# Onboarding

## Welcome to Countable!

The goal of this guide is to help new members of Countable get connected with the team, efficiently set up accounts, and learn key things to help you get started contributing! If you find a way to improve this document, send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/pull/new/master)! If anything is unclear, let's fix it so it's clear for the next person.

  * Get a countable.ca email address (ask your manager to create it), and [set up your signature](https://youtu.be/hA5cRIDg0Ko)
  * Use your email address to [sign up on our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/countable-web/signup).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team. Share your:
     * New Title

### Set your profile photo

  * As a remote team, it makes it easier for our team and clients to track who everyone is if you upload a profile photo. Upload your photo to all accounts, especially Slack, Email, BitBucket, GitHub.
  
### Set up a Timesheet

[See here](../../admin/accounting/TIMESHEETS.md)

### Team Calendar
  * Go to calendar.google.com from your Countable Google Apps account.
  * You should see our team calendar with meetings to attend.
  * When you are travelling, create an event indicating your time away and whether you're working 50% or 0%.

### Payment Info
  * Provide a void cheque (in Canada this includes your bank account number, routing/transit number and institution number) to our accounting staff.

### Environment
  * Set up a [physical space and equipment](./PHYSICAL_SETUP.md) to work.
  * devs only - Read about our [ops](../../product/engineering/OPERATIONS.md) and [coding standards](../../product/engineering/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
  * devs only - Complete the [training exercises](../../product/engineering/TRAINING.md) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Order a book that will help you learn your job, and bill the company for it.

  * (devs only) [Sentry](http://sentry.countable.ca). Join the `Sentry` team.

### How to Do Work

Skim this so you know the language and how we work [Project Management](./PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md).

### Confirm

You should now go on the slack #general channel and announce that you've completed onboarding, or we'll assume you haven't and complain.

### Before You Start working:
  * Skim this entire manual and take notes so you know what's in here.
  * If something *specific to our company* isn't in here, ask team mates for help liberally and ensure it gets documented concisely in the right place.
  * Review the [staff homepage](https://sites.google.com/countable.ca/countable-staff/home), for commonly used resources including the Google Drive stuff you can access. Sign in as countable email to view this page. 
  * It's a great idea to bookmark your timesheet URL (Google Sheet) and OKR URL (Google Sheet) in your bookmarks bar. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/admin/#inlinemodeladmin-objects . Because, you should access both of these things frequently.

### When you start working:
You'll be learning a lot, and we don't expect you to necessarily complete tasks every day when you work. But, you are expected to:
   * Let your team know what you did and what you struggled with, on Slack every day, because we need to know that in order to help you learn. It doesn't help anyone if you're stuck, and we want to help.
   * Commit your code and push it to `develop` or a new branch with a Pull Request every day.
   * Try your best to complete a tiny task, rather than partially finishing a big task.
   * Expectations that are required to be part of Countable (level 1) and for promotion are documented [here](./EVALUATION.md).
### How to ask for help:
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY14Er6JX2s, skip to 11 minute mark and watch steps for asking for help. Summary.
  * If you struggle more than 15 mins, ask for help. (if you're waiting for a response, move to something else meanwhile.)
  * Demonstrate competence - Be clear. 
  * Indicate what % done you are on the project. "I'm 30% done this, and stuck on X. I already tried A and B."
  * Show what you've already tried.
  * After you get a response, say it back to the mentor to demonstrate your understanding.
  * Document what you learned. If it will apply to others, put it in a public space such as this manual
