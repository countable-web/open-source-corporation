# Evaluation

The purpose of this policy is to "get and keep the right people on the bus" [1]. This page lists "job levels". Each employee should be assigned a level based on the behaviours listed below from levels 1 to 4.

# Process
  * Key Result score: What is your average score the last 4 months?
  * What does he score in the self-evaluation. For each item in your job level? Each question is either zero, half, or one point. Give yourself a percentage grade.
  * What is the biggest opportunity for improvement (getting to the next level career wise) and #1 strength that we should exploit.
  
Provide this information to your manager for feedback, and they will provide any adjustments and their perspective on your answers. The manager should indicate what's your biggest opportunity for improvement and strength as well.

## Technical Tracks
  * DevOps
  * Developer
  * UX / Design

Choose one of the above technical tracks that most closely matches your work and intended career direction. It won't be an exact match. You should also indicate detail on your exact technical track.

## Job Levels

This section is used in the Process above for self-evaluation.

### Level 1
An internship or Junior. Evaluation of fit to Countable's culture, work style and technical needs.

   * Regularly review other team members' work to learn from it (code reviews, XD links, shared videos, stage sites). To prove you are doing this you must ask questions.
   * Ask for help with (or more generally, be highly engaged with and discuss) your [OKRs](../../OKRS.md)
   * You regularly use this operations manual, ask questions about things that are hard to understand or you disagree with, and suggest improvements for clarity.
   * Try to solve problems yourself (10 to 30 minutes). If no clear solution was found, ask specific questions while providing details obtained from the initial investigation. Clarify and state your assumptions when you ask for help.
   * Make consistent small improvements to the systems around you (fix spelling or clarity of README files, small refactors such as renaming a variable for clarity, make a small design or usability improvement).
   * Show gratitude to your team (for example, mention them in the #thanks channel).
   * Share work (screenshots, staging links, XD links, code snippets) with the team in your client-<name> and guild-<name> channels, because seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very motivating.
   * Take responsibility for specific tasks you are assigned.
   * Notify your client when work is ready, with a link or screenshot for them to see.

### Level 2
Considered a permanent position. Works directly with clients and other stakeholders on delivering results, only escalating as needed.

   * Remind the team and clients about what our project goal and company goals are.
   * Show troubleshooting ability, to get to the bottom of issues in your technical track.
   * Your team and clients give positive feedback on your work speed and quality.
   * Give feedback on work that team members share (in your client-<name> and guild-<name> channels).
   * Share links (such as on Slack) to relevant pages in the Ops Manual to help guide the team (you should make an effort to do this rather than offer one-off answers to questions).
   * Manages client's expectation of deliverables and timelines. Is aware of bigger picture of project, and helps the team course correct to stay on track.
   * Help team members with their [OKRs](../../OKRS.md).
   * Take responsibility for large tasks (> 1 day) and breaks them down into Trello cards (< 1 day each).
   * Is aware of clients' satisfaction with work, and ensure a timely fix of issues they report.


### Level 3
Owns a client relationship, leads in a technical area within a guild, or takes on another area of responsibility.

   * Help to support and teach other team members things inside your technical track, OR takes responsibility for their results and timelines for at least one specific client or project with multiple team members assigned to it.
   * Makes some contributions to the Ops Manual.
   * Work towards a clear, shared goal with the client. Follow up on discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives). Once it's clear, prototype something to validate assumptions as quickly as possible.
   * Be competent in more than 1 technical track, and has basic knowledge of all 3.
   * Takes responsibility for clients' business results. Doesn't blame the client, or external factors. Find a way to achieve the desired outcome by working around challenges you cannot control.
   * Maximize iteration speed to get closer to the goals quickly. 
   * Take accountability for our team's role in business objectives and project health.
   * Tracks and improves metrics.
   * Takes responsibility for the overall success of one or more existing clients or projects.
   * For devs, acts condusive with the [Senior Developers](https://roadmap.sh/guides/levels-of-seniority#senior-developers) section of roadmap.sh developer levels. It's useful for other technical workers to review this as well.

### Level 4

Owns a guild, major client group or customer base (business line).
   * Sets standards for whole team in technical track OR responsible for a business area (contributes to several winning proposals and accounts)
   * Makes sure documentation is clear, and the team is improving in that area, making major Ops Manual contributions.
   * Stay on top of industry trends in technical track. Research, understand and explain trade-offs of competing solutions. Post about opportunities to improve (new tools and trends) in guild channels.
   * Work to integrate their technical area with the other technical tracks seamlessly in a ways that help the whole team. Be aware of how your work impacts other areas.
   * Set high level conceptual alignment and clarity of goals and strategy with clients.
   * Evaluate technical work complexity for proposals/quotes and can delegate work appropriately.

### Dismissal

While it sounds like a negative thing, not everyone is a fit for Countable's culture. We think many people are talented but could have a bigger impact elsewhere which is better for everyone. Things that could result in you being dismissed:
   * Fail to communicate with users, team, and customers resulting in problems.
   * Fail to exhibit most of the behaviours listed at and below your current job level.
   * Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how to prevent it next time.
   * Miss meetings or appointments.
   * Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
   * Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
   * Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes person" without thinking about what you're agreeing to.
   * Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project status (no response for over 1 business day, when a response is clearly expected)
