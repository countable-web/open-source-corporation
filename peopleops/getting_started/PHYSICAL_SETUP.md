# Setting Up Your Desk

You'll need:

  * Good quality headset with mic. Cheap options we've verified to work well: [wired](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Microphone-Cancelling-Lightweight-Headphones/dp/B06XWG12QS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1531614591&sr=8-2&keywords=headset+wired+-wireless#customerReviews) or [bluetooth](https://www.amazon.com/New-bee-Bluetooth-Cancelling-Headsetcase/dp/B07FMSJZ3R). Countable will reimbuse up to $40 on this.
  * A computer. If you're a developer, it should have either Linux or MacOS (we don't use Windows for work). If you're a developer or designer, you want 4GB or more of RAM, 128GB or more of disk, and a core i3 or better CPU. We recommend dell XPS series OR a desktop. We recommend Ubuntu LTS or Elementary OS.
  * A quiet, hopefully cool, room to work from with a stable internet connection. When you `ping 8.8.8.8` you should get no dropped packets or numbers over 100ms.

### Equipment Expenses

  * Countable will pay for a linux laptop if you use that as your primary work machine. We subsidize Linux because it helps the team learn about our servers, Docker and other critical components of our business that use Linux. We want a bias to moving as much infrastructure in that direction as possible but recognize not everything works there yet (Adobe, I'm looking at you).
  * For mac laptops, monitors, repairs and any other computer equipment you need, Countable will pay 50% up to $1000 per year.
  * We studiously avoid Microsoft Windows at Countable. It's not as automatable as Linux, and prevents people from learning Linux which is a core competency at Countable.
  * Countable may pay for co-working space if you need one, but it must be approved case-by-case currently.
