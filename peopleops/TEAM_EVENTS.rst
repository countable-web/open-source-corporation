Team Event Basics
------------------

As a company with remote employees, we intend that half of recreational
events can be attended online.

When in-person events are held in just one city, employees may
self-organize events in their respective cities and be reimbursed by
Countable. The default cap is $25/person, for other amounts please get
approval from your manager.
