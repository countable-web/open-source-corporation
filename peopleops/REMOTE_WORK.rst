Remote Work Basics
------------------

Countable is a fully remote team, which has certain pros and cons. The
top "cons" reported on other remote teams are:

-  Loneliness / Isolation
-  Collaborating / Communicating

Things to try.

-  Weekly team Lunch. Can we schedule a video call for a weekly lunch?
   Figure out what day works for everyone.
-  Shorter coffee-break video call, daily.
-  Video collaboration time on projects. Casual mob coding, async coding
   allowed too.
