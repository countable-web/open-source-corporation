  * Each team member determines their own hours and communicates that to the team.
  * We assume most people will not work on weekends or stat holidays, but you are welcome to. Try to work on your own on holidays so you don't pull someone in who was planning the day off.
  * While there are occasional emergencies that may require it, we try to minimize the pressure on people to work beyond 8 hours a day.
  * Indicate what hours you will work in the [staff schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zh6GYex7UtoZGyChRGNy8378brtxvfrOdtedf6z5c5M/edit#gid=0). This isn't written in stone but allows your team members to plan when to work with you. If you change it one day, just let your team know in advance.
