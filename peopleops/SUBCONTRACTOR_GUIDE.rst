Should You Incorporate?
-----------------------

This section is only if you're in Canada for now.

1. If you're working full time, it's likely worth it, otherwise probably
   not.
2. It costs $400ish to incorporate (form a CCPC), plus $40/yr. You also
   need to spend a day or so on extra book keeping, and a day doing an
   extra tax return each year. You'll likely want to pay an accountant
   $1000 to do the return for you, or get corporate tax software for
   $150 or up. **The real cost is something like $2000 per year when you
   start.**
3. The main tax benefit is you can defer income to another year to stay
   in a lower tax bracket. The corporate tax rate for small businesses
   is only about 15%, so if you want to save money for several years
   it's likely a good idea to leave that portion in your corporation
   rather than pay the 45% tax rate. If you're going to save the money
   for quite a while, fill up your RRSPs first. Then start saving it in
   your CCPC.
