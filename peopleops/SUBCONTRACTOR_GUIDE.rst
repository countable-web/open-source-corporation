Purpose
-------

Some of our team work as subcontractors rather than employees, so we provide resources to help guide them.

Scope
-----

Currently covers taxes, categorization as a subcontractor, and benefits of incorporating.

Taxes
-----

You have to claim self employment income once per year. We recommend
using `SimpleTax <https://simpletax.ca/>`__

1. We suggest signing up with mint.com, as it makes tracking all your
   expenses simpler.
2. Save all receipts for restaurants. You can deduct 50%
3. Computer equipment, deduct % used for work.
4. Internet, phone, deduct % used for work.
5. Rent, deduct the percentage of the room used for work, times
   percentage of time working there.
6. Deduct travel costs when working.
7. Full list -

Categorization as a Subcontractor
---------------------------------

1. You should supply your own computer equipment
2. You should determine where, when and how the work will be done.
3. Bears risk of loss, damage or delay.

Should You Incorporate?
-----------------------

This section is only if you're in Canada for now.

1. If you're working full time, it's likely worth it, otherwise probably
   not.
2. It costs $400ish to incorporate (form a CCPC), plus $40/yr. You also
   need to spend a day or so on extra book keeping, and a day doing an
   extra tax return each year. You'll likely want to pay an accountant
   $1000 to do the return for you, or get corporate tax software for
   $150 or up. **The real cost is something like $2000 per year when you
   start.**
3. The main tax benefit is you can defer income to another year to stay
   in a lower tax bracket. The corporate tax rate for small businesses
   is only about 15%, so if you want to save money for several years
   it's likely a good idea to leave that portion in your corporation
   rather than pay the 45% tax rate. If you're going to save the money
   for quite a while, fill up your RRSPs first. Then start saving it in
   your CCPC.
