Communications Charter
======================

Purpose
-------

We want to restict types of communication by channel so people aren't
stressed by having to listen on all channels at all times. For example,
we expect people to check email just once or twice a day, and not on
evenings or weekends, so don't feel guilty about not checking it on your
time off.

Scope
-----

Define how we use different communication channels for different
purposes.

Guidelines for All Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Where possible, communication is ``asynchronous`` because we have
   different schedules and often timezones too. This means it will often
   be a few hours or even a day before you get a response to Slack or
   Email messages.
-  For complex or emotionally charged conversations use voice (appear.in
   or phone)
-  Being brief in email/slack amongst ourselves is ok.
-  There are arguably two "modes" that people work in. "Focus mode" and
   "Collaboration mode". Slack is great when you're in collaboration
   mode, but it's ok to turn off all channels and focus on your work
   too.
-  It's always better to speak up if you have a concern, or any
   information that might be important to the group. If you're worried
   about how the group will react, say so. We're all commited to
   speaking up, and listening respectfully. We can't make the right
   decision without everyone sharing all their information. Find a way
   to share your concern, that you are most comfortable with.
-  Talk to your team and clients every single day you work. You should
   indicate what you're working on, and keep track of any special
   deadlines set by your team. For example, when you're blocking someone
   else or a client requests a special deadline.

Calendar Expectations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The calendar is the single source of truth for meetings. They are
   only held by people invited to actual calendar events.
-  We do reply to calendar invitations (within 24h, because that's the
   maximum frequency for checking email)
-  We make our calendars public (to show when we're busy, not exact
   events).
-  We add our vacations or holidays into the event calendar as
   following: ‚ÄúName‚Äù vacation (# of days )

Email Hygiene:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We recommend you disable email notifications on your phone. It's a
   non-urgent channel and we don't want to be distracted by it.
-  Email good for announcements, but should link to something in Trello
   (if it requires followup), Google Docs (if it is a resource we may
   need later), or `reddit <https://old.reddit.com/r/CountableWeb>`__
   (if it's a discussion).
-  The email channel is not urgent: 24h response time is ok. We
   recommend checking email only twice daily, only on weekdays during
   business hours. If the email is from a colleague, customer, or
   prospect, you must follow up within 24h of an email being sent if
   they expect a response. If a task is requested, either complete the
   task or reply indicating what steps you've taken, what's still
   needed, and when it will be completed with a link to a Trello card.
-  Respond to emails in a way that minimizes back-and-forth. Use a
   calendly link to book meetings if it's with just one other person.
-  No need to check emails during vacation (unless otherwise agreed
   upon). => see next line
-  You must have an autoresponder set when on vacaton: including return
   date from vacation / back-up contact and details / back-up person
   gets a briefing.
-  Use the "schedule send" option in gmail if sending after hours or on
   the weekend. it's a dropdown on the send button. This helps train
   team members and clients to take a break outside work hours.

Text
~~~~

-  If you'd like someone's attention because you're blocked and they're
   not responding on Slack, we recommend you text them. Do this only
   when necessary.
-  This means, we should share our phone numbers, but only use them for
   urgent requests.

Appear.in (Video Chat, and in-perosn meetings)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guidlines for communicating face-to-face

-  Make eye contact 50% of the time when speaking, and 100% of the time
   when listening.
-  Never speak for more than 1 minute without pausing for the other
   person to speak. If they don't, then you can continue.
-  Get in the habit of repeating things back to people concisely in your
   own words. It proves you actually heard them and gave it some
   thought.
-  Everyone in a group should speak some of the time, with contributions
   as equal as possible.

Phone
~~~~~

-  For truly urgent or critical things, we call each other (cell phone).
   Only do this in the evening or weekend of the recipient's timezone if
   it's an emergency. This should be RARE.

Trello
~~~~~~

-  Trello is for tracking what we need to get done (reminders). We use
   variants of Scrum, details
   `here <../peopleops/getting_started/TRELLO.md>`__.

Office Hours and Presence:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Overall objective: achieving our goals but also balancing work &
   private life in a meaningful way
-  However, also take team spirit, team efficiency and feeling of
   togetherness into account.
-  Make sure your calendar is up-to-date and shared/public so we know
   how to reach someone if urgent

Meetings in General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `meetings <./MEETINGS.md>`__

Reddit
~~~~~~

-  Use old.reddit.com/CountableWeb for public discussions. Private
   discussions can be held on slack. Try to make any discussion you can
   public, assuming personal and client's competitive information can be
   left out.

Slack Hygiene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following notification setting. You should only be notified when
people direct message or mention you, and only during your work hours.
|Slack Notification Setting|

-  Go straight to the point. Don't send people messages to check if
   someone's online, like "Clark", "hey, you there?", or "Can I ask you
   a question?". This sucks, because the person now has to stare at the
   screen for 2 minutes while you write them a message. Just get to the
   point and don't worry about when, they'll reply when they can. The
   expected response time on slack is up to 4 hours during the
   recipient's work hours, so they should check it twice a day. When
   people are in "focus mode", they shouldn't have slack open as it's a
   distraction.
-  If the message could be useful to more than one person, post it in
   the most relevant public or project channel.
-  No instant reply required. Our communication priority order is: 1)
   Call/Text 2) Slack 3) Email 4) Trello 5) Reddit
-  Try to interact with the team about twice per work day on slack, but
   don't leave it open all day, you need some quiet time to focus on
   work. Catch up on your channels, skim and respond where needed.
-  if you read something on a public slack channel, understand it, and
   find it useful, please give a thumbs up üëç or ‚úîÔ∏è or whatever emoticon
   . It helps the people who post in public channels the most to know
   who's read things and what to post.
-  The perfect example of what to use Slack for is: (1) When you're
   blocked by something, make noise to the team channel. (2) Create
   clarity around objectives and user stories. State your understanding
   in your own words so team mates can confirm we're on the same page.
