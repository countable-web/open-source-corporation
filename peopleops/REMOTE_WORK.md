# Remote Work

## Purpose

Countable is a fully remote team, which has certain pros and cons. The top "cons" reported on other remote teams are:

  * Loneliness / Isolation
  * Collaborating / Communicating
  
Things to try.

  * Weekly team Lunch. Can we schedule a video call for a weekly lunch? Figure out what day works for everyone.
  * Shorter coffee-break video call, daily.
  * Video collaboration time on projects. Casual mob coding, async coding allowed too.
