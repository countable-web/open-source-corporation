# Candidate Models

(draft)

These are topics we may want to document in this ops manual in the future.

  * Model Based Thinking. Absence of right and wrong, only a shared quest for the best model, trading off between simplicity and power.
  * Deployment instructions - use direct.domain.com CNAME, domain-stage.contable.ca for staging. Actual domain behind cloudflare for SSL, CDN
  * client and project slug methodology. The trello board, gdrive folder, repo, should all have the same name, lowercase with dashes.
