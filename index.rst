What Is This?
-------------

This is the `Countable Web Productions Inc <http://countable.ca>`__
*operations manual*. It's a living record of how our company works, and
is constantly evolving as we learn. Our whole team proposes amendments
in order to constantly improve the material here.

Like for an open source software project, our processes and other
information assets are publicly available for anyone to use under the
MIT license. *However*, just as an open source software project does not
disclose its database contents, this repository does not include any of
our clients' and employees' private data.

Purpose
-------

*First, why does this repository exist?* The purpose of this repository
is to document Countable's operations for convenient reference,
discussion and amendment.

   | Whenever you find yourself saying something for a second time (to a
     second audience, or in a second situation), it is highly likely
     that you will end up saying it again and again in the future. To
     vastly improve the quality of the communication, and reduce the
     amount of time that you spend communicating it â€¦ write it down.
   | Then, the next time you need to communicate that message, you can
     simply share it in written form. If it is something that all
     members of the team should know and remember, put it in a
     company-wide Wiki. If it is truly seminal to the organization, post
     it on a wall for all to see.

-- "The Great CEO Within", By Matt Mochary

*Second, why is it open source?* To promote
`transparency <./philosophy/TRANSPARENCY.rst>`__.

Scope
-----

This repo will contain:

-  Business processes and knowledge base.
-  The Articles of Incorporation and other general corporate documents.
   Countable is a
   `CCPC <http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html>`__,
   but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other
   organization structures.
-  Document templates used by the company for accounting and legal.
-  We will *not* publish information here that would compromise the
   privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. For
   example, *filled* timesheets, invoices and other documents with
   monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For
   these, only empty templates will be provided.

What is Countable?
------------------

Countable is a Web Technology Solutions Development Firm. We build
things with web technology. There are tens of thousands of companies
that do this. What makes us different?

-  We are obsessed with feedback. A remote team, feedback loops are
   harder to establish and even more critical to our ability to deliver
   great work. At Countable, feedback is sacred, and everyone is
   encouraged to maximize thoughtful feedback to one another as much as
   possible. We want our clients to see our work as we're doing it and
   be as visible as possible.
-  We're built to address the 3 main failure modes of software projects
   (over budget, overdue, and incorrect requirements). We do this by
   prototying, the art of simulating an experience with the minimum
   effort.
-  We work hard to be transparent, interactive, and have fun.

Who is Countable?
-----------------

We are selective in order to embody our `values <./philosophy/VALUES.rst>`__. This
starts with hiring, all the way to the kinds of partners we seek out. In
the end, we want to bring together people to have a big impact by
improving all the industries we engage with, through better technology
designed by the end users themselves. Those users are the ones who
understand their problems and need to given a voice to control the
technology they depend on. Now that's a feedback loop!

Contributing
------------

If you want to suggest a change to Countable Web Productions, make a
pull request. The rules:

-  *Important*: Never commit private data or protected intellectual
   property. Nothing specific to our employees, clients, or finances
   should go in here.
-  The easiest place to contribute an idea is by joining our company's
   `board of advisors <https://www.reddit.com/r/countableweb>`__ on
   reddit.
-  Organize by "context". The documents in here are intended to be
   actionable. So, for any document, place it with a name and folder
   structure that matches what someone is *doing when they need this
   information*. For example, a timesheet template should go in the
   GETTING_STARTED folder, since it will be used by new employees.
-  Link prolifically. Wherever you can, link words of your pages to
   other pages or other websites.
-  Keep it concise, to-the-point, actionable. If you do use an
   abstraction, provide a corresponding example.
-  Each page should state it's purpose for existing, as related to the
   company's `mission <./philosophy/MISSION.rst>`__. Clarity and utility over
   completeness. Try to maximize "usefulness density", or the total
   benefit (ie, in saved time, dollars) of the content divided by its
   length (in characters).
-  This repository is intended for a specific company (Countable Web
   Productions Inc.), if you want to use it for another company, please
   fork it.
