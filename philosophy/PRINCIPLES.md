# Principles

## Purpose

The purpose of this page is to address a specific issue with our [OKR](./OKRS.md) process, wherein by focusing exclusively on some OKR we neglect some important assumption we should have had all along. ie, by releasing fast we neglect privacy. These principles are listed in order of descending priority. We may measure some of these principles, making them into "committed OKRs".

## Scope


  * _Results are sacred_ - Processes, Roles, and other inputs are flexible and can be changed when necessary to achieve results.
  * _Ownership_ - Take ownership, or be aware of who has taken ownership for any outcome we attempt. Tell each other "i've got this."
  * _Privacy through simplicity_ - We MUST always be confident that anyone's private data is secure. When it comes to security private data, you SHOULD use the simplest solution as it's the most likely to be implemented correctly. The best is to never store private data. Then, if you must store it, minimize the number of people who can access it, and the ways the can access it.
  * _No complacency_ - If something is unclear or suboptimal, we make some noise about it. Also, we should ensure there is a strong feedback loop between peers in a team, and between us, our clients and their customers. The output of what you do SHOULD be highly visible to those it impacts, and to you. Give, receive, and act on feedback as frequently and immediately as you can.
  * _Audacity_ - We SHOULD do work that excites us and has a chance to change its industry.
  * _Transparency_ - We SHOULD do everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _Continuous Improvement_ - Always work to make things a little better than you found them. Many small improvements add up.
  * _Prototyping_ We publish simple but working models of products to real users, as a part of planning them, within weeks not months.
  * _Impact_ - We strive to help as many people as possible as a side-effect of our work.
  * _Consistency_ - We avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to automate and enforce consistency.
  * _Modelling_ - We reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive models. Help everyone on your project visualize the desired outcome.
  * _Diversity_ - We MUST encourage diversity of thought, treat everyone with respect, and work to avoid non-merticratic bias.
  * _Usability_ - We create software with an enjoyable, engaging user experience. Don't make the user think, wait, or do a task unnecessarily.
  * _Asynchrony_ - We prevent people needing to ask us for things, by putting all information and assets in a place our team can predict.
