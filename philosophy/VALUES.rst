Values

(draft)

Purpose
-------

Values are ideals that our team members share. This helps us improve
communication among one team. Knowing these values are held, many things
go without saying (and that's efficient). Values also help us find
customers and new employees who will get along with us.

Scope
-----

-  Challenging but supporting each other.
-  Act based on real feedback and data from customers and peers.
-  Continuous improvement.
-  Building trust based on shared goals.

Values Survey
-------------

We surveyed our team on what values they hold most highly, and the
results are:

::

   communication (18 points)
   usability (16 points)
   feedback (16 points)
   Several other items were tied at 15 points: learning, organization, clarity of vision, empathy.

We also tried keyvalues.com and this was our consensus selections
together.
