Purpose
-------

The purpose of this page is to address a specific issue with our
`OKR <./OKRS.md>`__ process, wherein by focusing exclusively on some OKR
we neglect some important assumption we should have had all along. ie,
by releasing fast we neglect privacy. These principles are listed in
order of descending priority. We may measure some of these principles,
making them into "committed OKRs".

Scope
-----

-  *Results are sacred* - Processes, Roles, and other inputs are
   flexible and can be changed when necessary to achieve results.
-  *Ownership* - Take ownership, or be aware of who has taken ownership
   for any outcome we attempt. Tell each other "i've got this."
-  *Privacy through simplicity* - We MUST always be confident that
   anyone's private data is secure. When it comes to security private
   data, you SHOULD use the simplest solution as it's the most likely to
   be implemented correctly. The best is to never store private data.
   Then, if you must store it, minimize the number of people who can
   access it, and the ways the can access it.
-  *No complacency* - If something is unclear or suboptimal, we make
   some noise about it. Also, we should ensure there is a strong
   feedback loop between peers in a team, and between us, our clients
   and their customers. The output of what you do SHOULD be highly
   visible to those it impacts, and to you. Give, receive, and act on
   feedback as frequently and immediately as you can.
-  *Audacity* - We SHOULD do work that excites us and has a chance to
   change its industry.
-  *Transparency* - We SHOULD do everything in the most public place
   that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
-  *Continuous Improvement* - Always work to make things a little better
   than you found them. Many small improvements add up.
-  *Prototyping* We publish simple but working models of products to
   real users, as a part of planning them, within weeks not months.
-  *Impact* - We strive to help as many people as possible as a
   side-effect of our work.
-  *Consistency* - We avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to
   automate and enforce consistency.
-  *Modelling* - We reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive
   models. Help everyone on your project visualize the desired outcome.
-  *Diversity* - We MUST encourage diversity of thought, treat everyone
   with respect, and work to avoid non-merticratic bias.
-  *Usability* - We create software with an enjoyable, engaging user
   experience. Don't make the user think, wait, or do a task
   unnecessarily.
-  *Asynchrony* - We prevent people needing to ask us for things, by
   putting all information and assets in a place our team can predict.
