"The Culture Code"
------------------

Team performance can be predicted by:

1. All members speak equally
2. Members maintain eye contact
3. Members communicate directly with each other
4. Members break from the team to focus or explore, and bring skills
   back to the team

These are more important for individual performance, so a manager's job
is to create "belonging cues" which foster the above behaviours. These
things also happen to make it more enjoyable to work together, which is
also important. We need to build trust in each other that Countable is a
safe place to try your hardest, knowing the team will support you
whether you succeed or fail. We need to trust each other enough to give
honest feedback when it's hard, so we can help one another improve to
the next level without getting stuck in a rut. We push each other
because we have high expectations for the team, and trust each other to
reach them.

"One Minute Manager"
--------------------

-  `Minute Manager <https://www.amazon.ca/Minute-Manager-Johnson-Spencer-Blanchard/dp/8172234996/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0>`__

This book is weird and "culty" but it's very concise and actionable, and
focuses on the time managers spend interacting with staff (actual
interactions). The fact that it reads strangely makes it more memorable
so may be a net positive. It also focuses on management by objectives
and creating clear goals (OKRs).

Quotes from the book:

One minute goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Plan the goals together and describe them briefly and clearly. Show
   people what good performance looks like.
2. Have people write out each of their goals, with due dates, on a
   single page.
3. Ask them to review their most important goals each day, which takes
   only a few minutes to do.
4. Encourage people to take a minute to look at what they’re doing, and
   see if their behavior matches their goals.
5. If it doesn’t, encourage them to re-think what they’re doing so they
   can realize their goals sooner.

One minute praise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THE FIRST HALF-MINUTE

1. Praise people as soon as possible.
2. Let people know what they did right—be specific.
3. Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it
   helps. PAUSE
4. Pause for a moment to allow people time to feel good about what
   they’ve done. THE SECOND HALF-MINUTE
5. Encourage them to do more of the same.
6. Make it clear you have confidence in them and support their success.

2. Confirm the facts first, and review the mistake together—be specific.
3. Express how you feel about the mistake and its impact on results.
   PAUSE
4. Be quiet for a moment to allow people time to feel concerned about
   what they’ve done. THE SECOND HALF-MINUTE

   that you think well of them as a person.
6. Remind them that you have confidence and trust in them, and support
   their success.
