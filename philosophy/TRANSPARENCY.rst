TRANSPARENCY
============

   Purpose
   Scope
   
Our policy is, any information that we don't have specific and serious
concerns about being released is to be made public.

There are data indicating transparency is important: "90% of job seekers
say that it's important to work for a company that embraces
transparency." (Glassdoor U.S. Site Survey, January 2016; \*Updated from
96%, Glassdoor survey, October 2014).

Other reasons:
--------------

1. To avoid secrets. Unnecesary secrets have a cost to the organization
   because everyone must focus on managing information access rather
   than other business activities (which create net value unlike hiding
   information).
2. Trust. Between any parties working with or within the Company.
3. Alignment and Clarity. We will be incentivized to design processes
   which benefit everyone. And failing this, at least expectations will
   be laid out.
4. Learning. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
5. Experimentation. An experiment on practical corporate transparency
   limits.

Caveats:
--------

1. As mentioned elsewhere, the need to be clear about what information
   is Confidential and careful it's not released along with everything
   else.
2. The cost of publishing everything on public channels. This should be
   mitigated by automating by convention and tools.
3. The cost of ensuring what's released is clear and interpreted how
   intended.

Examples of Things We Release Publicly:
---------------------------------------

-  Our operations manual
-  Financial and legal templates
-  (soon) Our corporate subreddit which acts as an advisory board
-  All our brand materials / assets for our company
-  Most (hopefully one day all) of our own source code

Exceptions (Sensitive Data):
----------------------------

We'll note specific exceptions here, where data is considered sensitive
and the minimum necessary people should have access.

-  Passwords to shared accounts
-  Clients' information (code, correspondence, documentation), or
   information about clients which they don't already have public.
-  information on, or belonging to, any users of systems we develop.
-  Employees' details other than their name, job description, photo, and
   things they've chosen to release.
