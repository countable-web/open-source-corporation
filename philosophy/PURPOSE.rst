Purpose
=======

(draft, purposes are hard and we do a lot of things... we are still
figuring this out and that's ok)

At the most abstract level, we want to solve the problem of information
context. With more data available than ever, the problem becomes getting
the right data at the right time.

To be less abstract, this typically manifests as:

-  Fixing feedback loops. Giving all stakeholders the right information
   at the right time to optimize decision making.
-  Put relevant data at users' fingertips to enable automation and
   effective, efficient workflows.

Examples of how we embody this purpose:

-  *Better Customer Journey Systems* - Improve customer experiences
   using web technology. With faster feedback loops via prototyping,
   Scrum and tools which improve transparency.
-  *Easier 3rd Party Web Components*: Website Owners should be able to
   install and manage their website from a single place, instead of
   having to find and manage many 3rd party component management
   dashboards.

The purpose statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us
work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and
colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission
to justify our projects and other pages of this manual.

Lesser purposes of the organization.

-  Provide an exciting, motivating place to work well, and on things we
   believe in.
-  Provide an environment optimized for learning quickly.
-  Continuously improve in how we approach our work.
