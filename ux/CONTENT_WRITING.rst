Purpose
-------

The purpose of this document is to ensure that all of Countable's
writing is thoughtful, professional and has a consistent voice.

Scope
-----

This document standardizes the voice and presentation of Countable's
content writing. This may include:

-  Blog posts
-  Proposal writing
-  Copy writing on countable.ca
-  Copy writing on various Countable sites and products

Formal Standards
----------------

To ensure professional presentation, all writing under Countable's name
must:

-  Be checked for grammar and spelling (if you are unsure of your
   grammar, please have another team member proofread)
-  Appropriately credit any work/images/references other than our own

Countable's Voice
-----------------

Countable's priority is to be professional, approachable, and above all,
USEFUL to our reader. This means we:

-  Use clear and direct language
-  Avoid use of industry jargon and acronyms; if they're used, provide
   definitions
-  Fact check any assertions made, particuarly technical ones - it's
   important we maintain a reputation of being experts in our field
-  Avoid spammy messaging trying to coerce or trick our reader into
   buying one of our products - our products should speak for themselves
-  Where appropriate, we can mention our products and their usefulness

Blog Writing
------------

When writing blog posts for countable.ca or one of our other sites,
please remember to:

-  Consider the site's user(s) and write "to" them: Who are they? What
   do they do? What are their needs? How can we help them?
-  Blog posts are ideally between 200-500 words
-  The more pictures, the better - if you can illustrate your points or
   advice with an image/screenshot, please do. Credit others' work
   accordingly (in most cases, a link to their site or where you found
   the image will suffice)
-  A blog's voice can be friendly and conversational, so feel free to
   add some (classy) humour, rhetorical questions, anecdotal experience,
   etc. You can include your own voice as well as the overall tone of
   Countable (see above).
