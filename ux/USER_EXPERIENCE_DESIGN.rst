User Experience Design
======================

(draft)

Scope
-----

Countable takes a Human Centered Design approach in its user experience
process.

Purpose
-------

Maximize the usefulness of our work product to its end users.

Process
-------

There are three major phases: User Research, Prototyping and Feedback.
These will overlap and repeat to some extent.

User Research
-------------

It's valuable to front-load much of the user research in a software
project so other work can be informed by information about real users,
not our assumptions.

Persona Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, identify the people who will interact with the work product
(Personas). Ideally, find a real person who embodies each persona and
stay in contact with them to collect feedback throughout the product
development.

Make a list of personas, and use those persona names consistently from
now on.

Interviews
~~~~~~~~~~

Interview representatives of each Persona to answer the following:

-  What problem are you solving for the persona? Why does that problem
   matter to them? What words do they use to describe the problem?
-  What is your Persona currently doing about this problem (prior to
   your solution)?
-  Take advantage of your "Fresh eyes" at this time, to identify needs
   does the user have that they're not consciously aware of. It's fine
   if you turn out to be wrong about these, just write them down to
   validate later.

Other Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interviews should be the primary source of information about your users,
but you may *supplement* this with surveys, anecodotes from your product
owner (the client, most often) and other data sets to inform stories.

Stories
~~~~~~~

-  Write user stories. This is a functional spec of your software. Be
   clear about what is should do for users.
-  Validate your stories with the product owner and users, and adjust.

Prototyping
-----------

It's beneficial to involve your personas and other stakeholders in the
below steps where practical (co-design workshop). This speeds up the
"validation" step, below.

-  For any project with a user interface, create wireframes that support
   the important user stories. Validate these against conversations with
   the target market.

Depending on the project, you may also want to develop:

-  For projects with nontrivial sequences of interactions over time,
   consider a customer journey map, or process diagram (BPD).
-  For projects with many user interfaces or many views, develop an
   Information Architecture diagram to show how different user
   interfaces are linked.
-  For projects with nontrivial off-screen actions, consider
   storyboarding the actions a user must take related to their use of
   the product.
-  Other project-specific resources as needed to get everyone on the
   same page about any aspect of the user experience which is important
   to more than one the stakeholders.

Validation
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Validate your wireframes and other planning materials with the
   product owner and users, adjust, and repeat until everyone on your
   team has a clear shared vision.
-  You're now ready to hand off the wireframes to technical team members
   to build a `functional prototype <./engineering/PROTOTYPING.md>`__.

Feedback
--------

While user experience design can be front-loaded in a project somewhat,
it's critical to continue throughout the project to ensure incremental
improvements are made and a great end result is achieved.

-  Conduct `usability tests <./USABILITY_TESTING.md>`__ of the
   functional prototype as you iterate on it, each sprint.
-  Perform follow-up interviews on users after they've tried the
   product.
-  Build a feedback mechanism (chat widget, form, etc) into the User
   Interface for a quick easy way to get contextual feedback from users.
-  Ensure developers understand the critical user flows in order to
   align with acceptance criteria for automated tests.
