From 2018 SEO Checklist
=======================

Google has about 200 "ranking factors". Top ones include:

1. number of similar words "on-page" in titles, url, headings, and body
   text, to the search term.
2. how many links on the internet point back to your site/page
3. how many people click your page in Google (CTR) by writing a good
   meta description, and how long they stay on your page (dwell
   time/engagement)

#3 is new in 2018, and more emphasized. the other #1 and #2 are old from
original pagerank algorithm

Having things render only in React/Vue/Riot tags (not on server side
render) is still a disadvantage. It's also important to review WMT,
ahrefs and Google App engine for clues on what works.
