   Scope
   
Official versions of Non-code assets are stored on Google Drive

Every client has a folder in our Company Google Drive named:

/clients//

Sharing
-------

For each client, this folder (and all its' contents) is shared with the
following people and no others.

-  The client's designated staff who we are working with, and showing
   our work to.
-  Our staff who perform work for that client.

Structure
---------

-  /clients//Mockups should contain all drafts and revisions of mockups
   for clients to approve and developers to work from. Make it obvious
   which is the latest one, by deleting old ones when a new one comes
   available.
-  /clients//Assets should container all sliced imaages and other raw
   assets for developers to include in their code projects.

Countable Marketing Folder
--------------------------

Here's the share link to our google drive cwp_marketing folder:
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iPhpEg1RuEz_ki4yNgzSOg9Z257Mpa7x?usp=sharing <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iPhpEg1RuEz_ki4yNgzSOg9Z257Mpa7x?usp=sharing>`__

All the old files are in there, but they've been organized into the
following categories:

1. cwp_logo: in this folder exists our most up-to-date logo, its
   styleguide, and an \_archive folder which houses all previous
   versions.
2. cwp_marketingassets: this folder has a lot of content - any
   individual assets that have been created for marketing purposes
   (business cards, social media profile images and banners, brochures,
   signage, video, team bios, CV, proposals, etc) AND their working
   files.
3. cwp_marketing: this folder includes a folder for our blog and a
   folder for various tradeshows and other marketing events.
4. cwp_website: another big one! This folder includes all of
   countable.ca's web design files, content strategy, and assets,
   including sliced images and the logo files specifically used for the
   website.

It is based on Felipe's folder design schema (attached) and this
