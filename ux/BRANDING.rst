Process

1. Brand development questionnaire
2. Discovery meeting (review other work, discuss answers to
   questionnaire). The person delivering the work must attend this
   meeting, in-person or web conference.
3. Develop creative brief (internal). Example

4. Propose sketches and color paletttes. Cherry pick key points from the
   creative brief to present.

Guidelines
----------

How can we get more buy-in, commitment, alignment and clarity earlier.

-  Validate the direction by reviewing other work together.
-  Inspiration board.

Demonstrating reasearch, expertise and intention in designs.

-  Provide about 3, no more than 5. "I've narrowed dozens of sketches
   down to the best 3. This is why I recommend these directions to your
   audience..."
-  Explain how the proposed designs capture their desired brand
   requirements, and appeal to the audience.
