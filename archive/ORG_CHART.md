## Law Firm Model
There already exists a consulting-based type of business where expertise is parcelled out to clients - the Law Firm. We will model after this structure. The company is organized into Senior Partners, Junior Partners and Associates. Another element we steal from Law practice is that billing is time-unit based by default.

It's not perfect, and these are seen as the Pros and Cons:

### Pros
  * Partnership structure offers a sense of ownership and accountability.
  * Time unit billing is very simple. Commission payment is simple. So, energy is not wasted on this.

### Cons
  * Value based billing has better incentive alignment with clients (so should be introduced where possible).
  * The Company has much lower margins at first glance. However, the Company will have less responsibility for project management under this structure so margins are an apples to oranges comparison.

## Roles

### Associate

  * Paid an hourly rate, as a subcontractor.
  * Excellent performance may lead to a Jr Partnership offer. This includes exhibiting taking responsibility for client outcomes and exceedin client expectations, technical prowess, strong communication skills and leadership.
  * Work is assigned and checked by a Jr Partner.

### Jr Partner
  * Is a primary contact for one or more client relationships.
  * Takes responsibility for one's clients, including planning work by others, and escalating key issues before they grow.
  * Considers the client's ROI on one's work and strives for a high multiple, at least 300% and ideally 1000% or higher.
  * Paid a percentage rate of billables, minus company Company overhead and referral payout.
  * Paid when billables are received, since they are responsible for collecting from clients. In the event of a default, the Company may pay up to 50% of the loss to the Partner if due process was followed for collection.
  * Will be eligible for an officer post.

### Sr Partner 
  * Has all the same responsibilities as a Jr Partner.
  * Owns a share in the Company, which must be purchased at 50% of market rate.
  * Deals with selection of Jr Partners.
  * Deals with escalation of issues in projects managed by Jr Partners.
  * Will be eligible for appointment to the board of directors.

### All Partners
Partners are expected to contribute some of the following, some of the time. The approximate commitment is a few hours per month. Beyond this a nominal stipend may be assigned when an initiative is approved in one of these areas.
  * Mentor and provide feedback to others in the Company.
  * Expected to be the expert on a few topics for the Company, and be aware of current literature there. The partner is expected to advocate their area of expertise is properly handled in projects.
  * Bring new business into the company (earning the referral commission as well on that business).
  * Make recommendatons on the Company's strategic direction.
  * Find ways to improve the Company's processeses (coding standards, CI, branch conventions, etc.)
  * Find ways to improve the Company's marketing (release public content, improve our website, find new channels for reaching clients).
