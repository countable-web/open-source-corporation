# Effort vs Impact Tags

As described on our onboarding guide, we use Trello for project management due to its simplicity and effectiveness in assisting us on our daily goals. Since we're dealing with a significative amount of tasks within a limited time frame we've implemented a **prioritizing system** where the product owner or the person that's assigned to the task could **estimate** the effort and impact that a certain card has.

## Implementing an effort vs impact system at your board.
1) Activate "Custom Fields" Trello power up.
2) Open any card by clicking on it.
3) On the section power-ups, click on "Custom Fields".
4) Click on "New field" then select "Dropdown".
5) Set the name as "PRIORITY vs IMPACT".
6) Start setting the options as follows:
- A+: Bugs! üêõ [LIGHT GREEN COLOR]
- C-: 8h x  Low Impact [RED COLOR]
- C+: 8h x Medium Impact [RED COLOR]
- B+: 8h x High Impact [YELLOW COLOR]
- C: 3h x Low Impact [RED COLOR]
- B: 3h x Medium Impact [GREEN COLOR]
- A: 3h x High Impact [GREEN COLOR]
- B-: 1h x Low Impact [YELLOW COLOR]
- A: 1h x Medium Impact [GREEN COLOR]
- A+: 1h x High Impact üî• [LIGHT GREEN COLOR]

## Estimates
Remember that the hours stated in each tag are a rough estimate of your effort. It's ok if you exceed it or finish your task faster than predicted. The main goal of it is just to compose this prioritization rank, without the intent to be highly accurate.

## What those ranks mean?
- Highest priority tickets are "Bugs" and then comes A+ 1h vs High Impact.
- High priority: A+, A, and B+
- Medium priority: B, B-
- Low priority: C+, C, C-. Also known as "if you have time" tasks. Avoid it if you have higher priority tasks to finish.


## Blocker Tasks
-  Sometimes a task is not categorized as a high priority, however, if not done immediately it would block some of your team members in any other assignments. If that's the case, click on the checkbox "BLOCKER TASK" to make it clear that this card must be delivered as soon as possible otherwise your team efficiency is compromised.
- **How to create it:** create a "checkbox" custom field named "BLOCKER TASK"

## BONUS
- Sorting all cards by priority is a time-consuming task. If you're at least Trello gold you could add another power-up called "Butler", that makes it possible to automatize repetitive tasks on your board. An interesting feature to solve this issue would be creating a card button to sort your sprint list automatically, by priority (custom field)
