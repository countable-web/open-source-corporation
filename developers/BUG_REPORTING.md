# Bug Reporting Process

These are the required steps for reportings bugs at Countable. Make on Trello Card per bug. Your job when reporting a bug is to make it clear to the developer how to see the bug.

1. Briefly describe the current behaviour and how it differs from the desired behaviour.
2. Include the exact URL where the issue can be observed.
3. Note what browser/device you are using unless it is Google Chrome (this is assumed otherwise).
4. List any further steps (specific clicks, etc) to observe the issue.
5. For aesthetic problems, take a screenshot and circle the problem in red.
6. For text problems, quote the problematic text.
7. Use a red "bug" label in Trello to mark bugs.
8. Assign the bug to someone who can either fix or triage it.

The developer will spend 2 minutes with your instructions trying to see your bug. If they can't, they'll comment in the card with what they tried, and archive your bug.
