## Project Structure and Ops

ALL projects MUST:
  * Have a README.md file with all information and/or links required for a new person to run the project locally, and any special requirements for deploying to production.
  * Be Dockerized, using docker-compose.yml.
  * Not reference the production URL in code. Save this in the docker-compose.override.yml for the specific ENV.
  * Not save secrets in code. Save these in the specific docker-compose.override.yml for the specific ENV.

ALL projects SHOULD:
  * Use PORT 80 to access via the browser, and to access APIs. This way we never have to think about what port things are on in different environments.
  * Use our standard stack choices.
  * Automatically run tests, stage the `develop` branch for anyone to look at, and automatically deploy the project to production from the `master` branch.

## Automation

Never block the developer. We own our tools, not the other way around.

The core principle of Countable's code projects is they automate everything other than the core domain problems the developer is working on. The developer should never have to take an extra manual step to start up a project, deploy, debug, or restart in order to apply changes. Any extra steps that interrupt development flow should be automated. For example:
  * Linters should auto-fix issues, and only issue warnings in the case of issues that can't be auto-fixed.
  * Minimize startup time. It should only take a few seconds or less to start up a project after the first installation.
  * Migrations should be run automatically on startup, not require a manual step.

## Project Structure

We use the monorepo pattern, meaning all files required to run the project (other than secrets and private data) go in a single GIT repository, structured as:

```
project-slug/
  web/
    Dockerfile
    app1/
    app2/
    app3/
    manage.py
  frontend/
    Dockerfile
    package.json
    src/
  nginx/
    Dockerfile
    nginx.conf
  static/
  docker-compose.yml
```

Example [here](https://github.com/countable-web/countable-modern-django).

The front-end Dockerfile should run a development server, but for production should just build static files, into the /static folder which is served by nginx.

## Front End Development
 
 (draft, rfc)
 
  Front-end development is exciting, but also a challenge. This is due to the fact that there are so many tools available for   so many different things, and this side of the world moves fast. Main considerations:
  
  1. Browser compability - Does the website look good on Chrome? Firefox? Ipad? Galaxy? iPhone?
  2. Device compatibility (Responsive Design) - On monitors that are not 1080p? 10 inch laptops at 1280 x 720?
  3. Automation
  
   
  
Now a days, you don't necessarily need to CODE for this, since there are tools like Babel, Normalize.css, Autoprefixer which help make this happen.

On larger sites with an accessibility budget:

 4. WAI-ARIA (Web Accessbility Initiative)

TLDR: Your website needs to work on the browsers that the client needs them to work in. Countable's website should be a flawless experience in ALL platforms.

**Tools**
 
Tooling for different areas can be in any of the following status:
  * Unspecified - Use whatever you want as long as it's well supported.
  * Recommendation - We recommend using a specific tool, but developer expertise or another reason could override this.
  * Standard - You should only deviate from this tooling choice for a specific reason.

**CSS**

  * We prefer SASS https://sass-lang.com/
  * Use a CSS reset.
  * *TODO:joao - what are the top 3 most important things to follow for developing CSS.*
  
**HTML**

  * Always populate the TITLE and META DESCRIPTION tags with a description of what's on the page, as they're critical SEO signals.
    
**Front End Framework**
  
  * We currently recommend Vue.js for new projects.
  * RiotJS is acceptable for lightweight situations with no bundler (NPM) available.
  * We use Parcel.js as a bundler.
  * Several older projects use jQuery, Angular and other frameworks.
