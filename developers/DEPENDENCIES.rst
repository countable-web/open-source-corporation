Dependency Strategy
===================

This page covers dependency selection and management.

How to Pick Dependencies
------------------------

-  Dependencies have a maintenance cost. Use as few as possible.
-  Pick dependencies that do what you need, and expect to need, and no
   more.
-  Pick dependencies with active support (> 5000 GitHub stars, recent
   commits)
-  If you really need a dependency with under 5000 GitHub stars, assume
   you may need to fork it in the future. These kinds of projects are at
   very high risk of becoming abandoned.
-  Be wary of sub-dependencies (jquery-cors). It's better to use a
   dependency with fewer upstreams (node-cors).
-  Minimize the size of the entire dependency tree. Dependencies closer
   to the underlying language or browser are better, and more likely to
   have a reasonable upgrade path because they are higher in the tree.

Javascript Frameworks
---------------------

Javascript frameworks are a big discussion and there isn't a nice answer
IMO. The problem is our projects often live for 5 to 10 years.
Javascript frameworks do not.

The problem of using the "framework of the day" is that javascript
frameworks only grow for about 3 years and then they always slowly die.
jQuery is slowly fading away now, Angular has peaked and is losing
market share to React. React is close to peaking and is starting to lose
to Vue. By next year, Vue will be more popular than either angular and
react and it's a better framework so the answer is to use Vue, right?

The problem is, we build 5 apps in Vue, and then something else replaces
it in 2 to 3 years, and we now have to support old apps in so many
frameworks with dying communities. here are Pros and Cons of the major
frameworks we consider:

-  jQuery is kind of unique since it's really a DOM library and not a
   framework. It's largely unnecessary now except as a plugin dependency
   and for animations. Otherwise, document.querySelector has replaced it
   (along with other modern dom methods, and fetch()). jQuery is also
   quite unprescriptive and so relatively harmless as a dependency
   compared to other libraries.
-  Angular is currently a bit of a mess because it's split into 2
   communities, Angular and AngularJS which are diverging frameworks. It
   also prescribes a lot of things like how to do Ajax, for no reason.
   However, we have it in several projects and it does the 2 way dom
   binding well making complex UI interactions simple.
-  React is nicely scoped to just a single purpose, the view. And it's
   not split up like Angular is into 2 communities. However, while it
   doesn't over-prescribe in your application architecture, it does want
   you to use Webpack and require based architecture, which is awkward
   to work into existing projects. This (like angular) makes it tend
   towards an all or nothing approach. We also don't currently use React
   so it seems better not to throw it on the pile. Preact seems strictly
   better since it's identical but faster, with less plugin support.
-  Vue suffers none of the above issues and is an easy to learn,
   succinct 2 way binding lib. But, do we want to start using yet
   another lib that does the same thing?
-  Riot is like Vue or React, but simpler and less popular. Riot works
   well with Django because it has a powerful interoperability mechanism
   (observer pattern), and doesn't really prescribe much of anything so
   it's easy to add in at any time. However, Riot also has some
   fragmentation in its community, as v4 was a complete rewrite and
   introduced breaking changes from v3. Our projects still use Riot v3.

So, this is the policy for now, open to discussion of course:

1. For projects already using jQuery, you can use it, but ideally also
   slowly migrate away from it.
2. For projects already using Angular, we'll probably stay with it for
   quite some time.
3. For a new "single page app", you could use (in order of descending
   preference) Riot, Vue, Preact, React or Angular.
4. Avoid framework-specific sub-dependencies like react-hamburger-menu
   or angularstrap. Framework plugins are the first thing to die when
   the framework dies. Use dependency-free, specific purpose plugins if
   you need any.
5. For a new Django project, use vanilla javascript with maybe some Riot
   tags. For small interactive front end pieces, something like Preact
   or Riot is pretty ideal because they're tiny. They're so small that
   if they go out of support we can fork them. Also, they're so simple
   that a much smaller portion of your app needs to be coupled strongly
   to the framework. It's easier to port out of them. The only really
   helpful feature in React and Angular is the 2 way dom binding. The
   rest of their features are of very dubious value. So, by using a
   library like Riot that only has just that, a 2 way dom binding, you
   have way less risk associated with the dependency. Less of your app
   depends on it. Lastly, you get better performance since they're
   small, as a nice bonus.
