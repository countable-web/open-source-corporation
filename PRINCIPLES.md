This is an early draft. it's just notes and not actionable yet.
  * _The Empowerment Principle_ - Empower people with knowledge of high level goals, and the ability to make progress towards those goals. This includes lending your ear to remove roadblocks.
  * _The Collaboration Principle_ - Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * _The Disrutption Principle_ - Do work that excites us and has a chance to affect change in its' industry.
  * _The Direction Principle_ - Collaborate to keep and updated list of specific opportunities shared with our team.
  * _The Transparency Principle_ - Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _The Systems Principle_ - Continuously work on improving our processes to create a productive work environment.
  * _The Clarity Principle_ - Strive to achieve *clarity* in all that we do. The founder (Clark Van Oyen) believes a lack of clarity (ambiguity, uncertainty and lack of the right communication) to be the number one cause of failure in software projects overall.
  * _The Value Principle_ - maximize total value creation. Our everyday activities should result in additional content/value shared online.
