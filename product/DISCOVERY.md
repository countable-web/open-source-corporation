# Project Discovery

## Purpose

Our first job on a project is to create a clear shared vision to set the team up for rapid progress toward product-market fit.

## Scope

Checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

## Kick-off Meeting
  
For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these critical questions.

Goals: Get an initial understanding of the problem, and the project success vision. Start the stakeholder map, so we can loop those people in and make them feel part of the team. Get clarity and empathy on what the users really need, and set the process underway to refine that knowledge (Get buy-in on user research).

Understand the problem:
  * What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list of the personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis or value proposition).
  * How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
  * What is the SINGLE most important benefit you expect this project to provide to the user?

Envision what it would be like if magically solved:
  * What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much detail as possible about that vision.
  * How will success overall be measured (what numbers would move)?
  * What is the ideal overall measurable impact of the project to the organization? What about on those it serves?

Identify stakeholders:
  * Who will we get to work with and in what capacity? (make a list) Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
  * Who else is involved with, affected by, or has input into this project, and how?

Next Steps:
  * What assets and access is required for the project and who will provide it, by when?
  * Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and team. What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
  * What are the first key deliverables, by whom, and by when, in order to accelerate the project? Include a UXD / user resarch plan, draft of User Epics, and critical path document (phased deliverables, including prototype phase), stakeholder map.

## User Experience Design (UX) Planning

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above answers to develop a [user experience design](./USER_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md) research plan.

## For Branding and Visual Design Projects
  * Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are close to what they want.
  * Use the branding questionnaire.
  * If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual primitives if new ones needed.
  * Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
