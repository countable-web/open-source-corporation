# Developer Guild (RFC)

## Purpose

The developer guild exists to:
  * Develop lightweight standards, style and conventions that reduce/avoid technical debt and continuously improve code quality across all projects, and make it easier for Countable develoeprs to switch projects, knowing what conventions should be used globally.
  * Create a great learning environment, where we can all help each other improve as devs.
  * Help Countable deploy better quality work infront of real users, more quickly.

## Scope / Methods

  * Monthly meetings with workshops to accomplish the above.
  * Mob / pair coding sessions
  * Code reviews
