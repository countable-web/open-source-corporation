# SEO

Google has about 200 "ranking factors". Top ones include:

1. number of similar words "on-page" in titles, url, headings, and body text, to the search term.
1. how many links on the internet point back to your site/page
1. how many people click your page in Google (CTR) by writing a good meta description, and how long they stay on your page (dwell time/engagement)

#3 is new in 2018, and more emphasized. the other #1 and #2 are old from original pagerank algorithm

It's also important to review WMT, ahrefs and Google App engine for clues on what works.
