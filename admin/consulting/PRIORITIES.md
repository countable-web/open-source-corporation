# Priorities

This is an ordered list of priorities when doing work for clients.

1. Critical downtime events or other urgent bugs. If a service has a serious loss of function the top priority is to restore it, keeping the client updated as you go. When the issue is resolved, discuss with your team how it should have been prevented (staging process, automated test, etc)
2. Communicating with clients. Check emails and Trello at least twice per day (I recommend exactly twice). Prefer Trello for all task related communication. Respond to emails from clients addressing their concerns. If you don't know how, CC the appropriate person (your manager if unsure) in your response asking for their input. In your response, indicate the time which you expect technical items addressed. ie) "This will be done by Thursday" and set that date in the Trello ticket if you need a reminder.
3. Fixing high impact bugs. Things which affect other team members' or your own work, or are highly visible to the client.
4. Communicate with your team. Unblock others. Is any team member actively waiting for an output of yours? Do that before other work.
5. Get feedback on your work. At least once every 24 hours, share something with team members, end-users or clients (a code review, screenshot on slack, little text update on what you're working on, shared a link). Keep trying to improve the frequency and quality of feedback you're getting on your work.
6. Work on cards that have the most impact on your Key Results. 
7. Implement cards top to bottom in your Sprint columns of your trello boards, to minimize how much work ends up being late.
8. Go back and make things a little better than you found them. Improve your work so you can be proud of it. Can we improve test coverage, user experience or anything else we forgot to cover in our cards?
9. Grab more cards from your Backlog (top to bottom).
