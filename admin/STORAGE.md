# Storage

## Scope

This page should make it clear where all work is saved.

## Purpose

To enable anyone to find any file or asset, without having to ask the person who created it where it is. For example:
  * devs need to find sliced versions of assets
  * clients and other team members need to find mock-ups, and know which is latest, such as XD links.
  * artists need to find raw project files in order to be able to take over each others' work.

Every file we create should have one obvious place that it is stored. If there seem to be 2 or more options as to where a file is stored, we should clarify our process.

## List of Storage Locations

We should store things only in the places and ways described below.

| System  | What Goes Here | Who Has Access |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GitHub - this repo  | Document how and why we do things | Everyone in the world |
| GitHub | Open source code | Everyone in the world |
| Trello | Work requests, tasks. Never store work deliverables here, only links to Google Drive | The specific client and project staff |
| Bitbucket | Private source code | The specific client and project staff |
| Google Drive `/clients/<client slug>/<project slug>` folder | Private client files (such as artwork) | The specific client and project staff |
| [Google Drive `/team/` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12iWzlcOP_qdFlVcM_U1yLVKB6IDq4Uvd) | Private company data (minimize this) | Our staff |
| [Google Drive `/public/` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Do2l9oaPHlyJ-J6w-BoGAvUmJjK1mDk3) | Any public assets (maximize this) | Everyone in the world |
| Google Drive (your own folders) | Never store anything here | You |
| Your local computer | No more than one day's work | You |

Never share work directly in slack by uploading it. Only share links to things stored in the correct place in Google Drive.
