# Areas of Responsibility (AOR)

## Purpose (Why)
The purpose of AORs is to determine what work matters most to Countable's mission, and make specific team members accountable for improving and tracking progress on each one. An AOR is an area of work that we've identified that someone should be responsible for. That person is the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the AOR, and ensures it's clear why AOR is important, determines the top priority for doing better in that AOR, and tracks progress towards that priority. We'll know that AORs are a success by checking whether employees can easily create process documents that are easy for the team to understand and follow.

## Scope (What)
This document is intended to standardize and clarify the process of owning an AOR. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6VesJN11u7oxYceimjOucrW-7Be62JRianhzuy68kQ/edit#gid=0) lists the responsibilities necessary for Countable to achieve its' mission, and who's accountable for them. Each AOR is assigned a DRI, and an heir who is shadowing and assisting the owner.

## How to Manage an AOR
Owning an AOR comes with great power and responsibility. Within the constraints of this page, you may manage your area as you see fit. As a DRI:

You MUST:
  * Document any processeses the team is required to follow under your AOR in the Ops manual.
  * Champion your AOR and ensure everyone follows its process. If someone doesn't follow the process you're overseeing, you must send them a link to the documentation page.
  * Evaluate and report to the team. Report on any KPI.

You SHOULD:
  * Measure how effectively the AOR is contributing to our mission at least every 3 months.

## Writing Ops Manual Pages

This is *draft*. Please take these as a rough guide for now, and let me (cvo) know what works and what doesn't. You can add sections not documented here.

An Ops Manual page MUST:
  * be written to help employees achieve our mission and create value for our customers.
  * have a "Purpose" heading which concisely summarizes why the document exists, because we want to ensure the area is important to our mission. This SHOULD indicate how we can measure success.

An Ops Manual page SHOULD:
  * Have a "Scope" section that identifies what area of work is being discussed, and any definitions to clarify what follows, because we want each process document to be focused on a specific area of work.
  * Contain bulleted lists of process steps and rules. (Use [this document](./AOR_TEMPLATE.md) as a template)
  * Use clear language, with the keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD" where applicable because we want to be clear. ie, "Developers MUST use Docker for apps with more than a single process, and SHOULD use Python on Node.js for web application back ends." "MUST" means the DRI should track and work towards compliance of the process. "SHOULD" means it's a recommendation to follow when reasonably convenient.
  * Be concise and have as few rules as possible, becasue it's easier for employees to understand. State the rules declaratively, as a matter of fact, not opinion.
  * Clearly state the logical purpose, evidence or citation that indicates how the rules help our mission because we want each rule to justify its' existence. However, you SHOULD judge which rules are self-evident in order to stay concise.
