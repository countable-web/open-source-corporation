Countable's Social Media Posting Policy:



Purpose of posting:
- Inspiration, for now, to inspire our team mates and clients with our work, and work we admire
- Lead generation via followers

Attribution:
- In order to avoid confusion between our work and others', all photos and designs not owned by us or in the public domain must be properly attributed to the original owner
- This credit can be posted in the image caption

Subjects:
- Work samples
- Work that inspires us (be clear which is which)
- Team photos
- Industry-related memes and inspirational photos

Themes/aesthetic:
Instagram:
- Our feed is tiled in an alternating dark & light image layout
- Wherever possible, use colours close to Countable's brand colours (blues, blue-greens, black and white)

Re: Clients' privacy:
- No posting screenshots of code
- Some clients' work is private, so always check with Clark before posting it
- Anything already public should be ok

Note:  For the time being, anyone other than Julie who wishes to post on Countable's instagram should save their post as a draft for Julie's review before posting, to ensure the above policy has been followed.
