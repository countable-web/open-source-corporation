This is a primer on our team's approach to methodologies used to structure our work.

In general, we do not take a prescriptive approach to methodology. We use methodologies as a toolbox. First, seek to understand the problem as deeply as possible. Then, evaluation methodologies and select those which best address the specific context for your project.

Here is a guide to specific methods, and when to use each.

1) *Scrum* - A versatile project management (PM) methodology which provides efficient change management (via backlog), regular meetings with stakeholders, continuous deployment and project velocity measurement. Use for any project with stakeholders who will be engaged throughout the project. The more and the greater variety of stakeholders, the more important a fully implemented PM methodology (Scrum) is needed.
2) *Prototyping* - Man plans, god laughs. Instead of planning every detail (guessing), why not build a quick approximation of your end goal? Prototyping an excellent way to conduct and validate planning. A cheap prototype lets you validate technical feasibility, market fit, usability and aesthetics without guessing (planning). Use for any novel product (different from existing ones), particularly if there may be many unknown unknowns to test for.
3) *Wireframes* - A lighter prototype that only includes the navigation (page structure) of your product. Use for any product with non-trivial use cases. Useful if a design process may come later and coding is being done first.
4) *Use cases* - Determine who will use the product, and how. What specific goals do users have and what steps does your product take to fulfill them?
5) *User stories* - A variation on Use Cases, and part of Scrum. Emphasizes a deep understanding of the Actor's point of view and context. Use for any new project that involves developing a product.
6) *Visual Mockups* - A non-functional prototype. Displays the exact look of the finished product. Use for any public facing product. Useful if wireframes or an unattractive prototype already exist, or for brand new projects.
7) *SEO Research* - Focused on search engines, but serves well as a general purpose market research tool. Identify what words your market uses, and the volume of searches with those words. Then, get ranked well for them. Use to understand and acquire customers.
8) *Usability testing* - Observe actual users interacting with your product, and identify obstacles and opportunities in their behaviour. Use on flows you need the user to complete reliably.
9) *Creative brief* - A lightweight design process kick-off document to identify the project goal, audience, proposed tone/character, and summarize design deliverables. Use before undertaking substantial creative/branding work.
