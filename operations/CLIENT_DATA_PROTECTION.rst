Purpose
-------
To identify what we do to protect client data, and all data in general, at Countable.

Scope
-----
Covers principles, policies, and web app security.

Principles
----------

As an open transparent company, we want to minimize the number of assets which need protection. Here's a list of those we can't make exceptions for:

-  Any real financial numbers.
-  Any client's database (particularly their customer data).
-  Any client's intellectual property which is not already open source.

Other associated risks:

-  Availability - minimize any downtime of client web properties.
-  Durability - avoid losing any data stored in clients' databases or image assets.

Policies
--------

-  Only provide team members access as needed. Don't provide access to client assets unless necessary to perform the team member's work.
-  During offboarding, destroy all client assets on the contractor's computer.
-  Never download any protected information you don't need on your PC. When finished work on a project, delete any protected information you had to store locally. Never save protected information anywhere on the cloud or on storage media other than official company channels without first obtaining approval in writing.
-  Laptop disks should be encrypted with the user's password. This option can be enabled when installing Ubuntu Linux.
-  Do not share accounts where protected information is present. Each user has their own account.

Endpoint Physical Protection Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Any confidential data should reside only on an encrypted disk of your computer.
-  Confidential data must not be synced to personal cloud accounts.
-  Do not leave your work computer unattended outside your home.
-  Your work computer must switch to a password lockscreen after waking up from sleep mode, and should enter sleep mode within half an hour of being idle.

Web App Security
----------------

-  Apply "least privilege". Do not open any ports that aren't needed for using the application. If you must open such a port for debugging, do so in your .gitignored environment only, so it's not shared.
-  Use our DevOps templates so all servers observe a single secured provisioning strategy.
