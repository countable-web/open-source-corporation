Writing Ops Manual Pages
-----------------------

This is a *draft*. Please take these as a rough guide for now, and let me (cvo) know what works and what doesn't. You can add sections not documented here.

An Ops Manual page **MUST**:
  * be written to help employees achieve our mission and create value for our customers.
  * have a "Purpose" heading which concisely summarizes why the document exists, because we want to ensure the area is important to our mission. This SHOULD indicate how we can measure success.

An Ops Manual page **SHOULD**:
  * Have a "Scope" section that identifies what area of work is being discussed, and any definitions to clarify what follows, because we want each process document to be focused on a specific area of work.
  * Contain bulleted lists of process steps and rules. 
  * Use clear language, with the keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD" where applicable because we want to be clear. ie, "Developers MUST use Docker for apps with more than a single process, and SHOULD use Python on Node.js for web application back ends." "MUST" means the DRI should track and work towards compliance of the process. "SHOULD" means it's a recommendation to follow when reasonably convenient.
  * Be concise and have as few rules as possible, becasue it's easier for employees to understand. State the rules declaratively, as a matter of fact, not opinion.
  * Clearly state the logical purpose, evidence or citation that indicates how the rules help our mission because we want each rule to justify its existence. However, you SHOULD judge which rules are self-evident in order to stay concise.
