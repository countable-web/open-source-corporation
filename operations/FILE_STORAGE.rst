Storage
=======

Scope
-----

This page should make it clear where all work is saved.

Purpose
-------

To enable anyone to find any file or asset, without having to ask the
person who created it where it is. For example:

-  devs need to find sliced versions of assets
-  clients and other team members need to find mock-ups, and know which
   is latest, such as XD links.
-  artists need to find raw project files in order to be able to take
   over each others' work.

Every file we create should have one obvious place that it is stored. If
there seem to be 2 or more options as to where a file is stored, we
should clarify our process.

List of Storage Locations

We should store things only in the places and ways described below.

Never share work directly in slack by uploading it. Only share links to
things stored in the correct place in Google Drive.
