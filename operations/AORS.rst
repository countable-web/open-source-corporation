The purpose of AORs is to determine what work matters most to Countable's mission, and make specific team members accountable for improving and tracking progress on each one. An AOR is an area of work that we've identified that someone should be responsible for. That person is the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the AOR, and ensures it's clear why AOR is important, determines the top priority for doing better in that AOR, and tracks progress towards that priority. We'll know that AORs are a success by checking whether employees can easily create process documents that are easy for the team to understand and follow.

## Scope (What)
This document is intended to standardize and clarify the process of owning an AOR. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6VesJN11u7oxYceimjOucrW-7Be62JRianhzuy68kQ/edit#gid=0) lists the responsibilities necessary for Countable to achieve its' mission, and who's accountable for them. Each AOR is assigned a DRI, and an heir who is shadowing and assisting the owner.

## How to Manage an AOR
Owning an AOR comes with great power and responsibility. Within the constraints of this page, you may manage your area as you see fit. As a DRI:

You MUST:
  * Document any processeses the team is required to follow under your AOR in the Ops manual.
  * Champion your AOR and ensure everyone follows its process. If someone doesn't follow the process you're overseeing, you must send them a link to the documentation page.
  * Evaluate and report to the team. Report on any KPI.

You SHOULD:
  * Measure how effectively the AOR is contributing to our mission at least every 3 months.
