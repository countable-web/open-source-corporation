# Consulting

The purpose of this section is to share knowledge about providing the best results for clients.

### Managing Work Tasks With Clients

We use Trello because:
  * it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
  * is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

### Billing
  * By default, clients are billed monthly based on consultant timesheets.
  * In some cases, specific projects may implement a custom billing contract such as a flat rate for a specfic statement of work.
  * Any technical work done for a client is rounded up to the nearest hour. This is intended as a reasonable incentive for clients to help us reduce context switching costs without being long enough to actively encourage context switching on our end.

### Methodology
  * Understand the client's business. What is their largest market? How did/does it grow? How do they interact with customers? What are those customers' top benefits, and top concerns?
  * Answer the question, of new projects: "How will we know if this project's succeeded?" Answer it as clearly as possible and write it down in a prominent place. All tasks hence should clearly move us toward the stated result.
  * Develop a clear domain language (words used with the client) and use them throughout the project and codebase.
  * Nurture a relationship of collaboration between all stakeholders to increase the pie rather than worry how to split it.
  * Use agile methodology as a toolkit, where applicable.
  * Build systems which avoid recurring maintenance through choice of stable components and automation. It's best to work ourselves out of a job. It always leads to more work.
  * Identify big opportunities for wealth creation and high expected (statistically) ROI. Small risks are worthwhile if there is a high upside.
  * Consultants (technical or non) work directly with clients, and no intermediary. The consultant must learn when is appropriate to escalate, such as: before providing a quote or estimate of new work; when in doubt about the best way to capture ROI; when uncertain about an impactiful decision. A more senior staff person will provide mentorship when escalation occurs.

Specific "off the shelf" methodological tools we often reach for are listed [here](./METHODOLOGY.md).

### Quotes
Clients may request a budget in an RFP, or a quote for a specific piece of work. Keep the following in mind:
  * Break the work down into about 1 day line items (8 hours), with appropriate level of detail. On larger projects, up to a week can be in a single line item.
  * Our minimum quotable amount is $3,000. Amounts below this should instead be approved via a simple email message or Trello ticket from someone authorized to approve the work.
  * Separate quotes or budgets to be completed at different phases and specify the order (priority).
  * The quote should provide a clear scope of functional specification, and list assumptions it is based on in order to simplify determining whether later changes are in scope or not.
  * Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc_xjX-SnOvQ9QemLBrsYtPrBZISqT4H7qFw_Wkn3Co/edit#gid=0).
  * The big caveat with providing a quote, is it affects the work outcome. It may help keep the team focused on what's promised in the quote, but also may prevent fixing problems we find along the way, or looking into opportunities because of the concern of scope creep. This may result in a substantial loss of competitive advantage so we'd encourage our clients to avoid using quotes most of the time. Instead, budget 25% of the original budget for a prototype to multiply your knowledge of the problem at hand, and the decide what to do. At this point the work will likely be much more clear and incremental.
