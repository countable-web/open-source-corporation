-  Observe our IT Security Policy.
-  Do not promote the Province of BC being our customer in marketing materials (promotional purposes) without prior written consent.
-  You need to go through a process for accessing protected information from the Province, including a criminal background check.

-  Do not use production data in development, test or training environments without consent from the Province.
-  Use CloudFlare infront of all services deployed, as it provides various security requirements.
-  Automatic security patching must be enabled on all production servers.
