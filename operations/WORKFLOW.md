# Workflow Checklist

These are mostly things we should already be doing. If it's something we're still working towards, it's in _italics_.

## Meetings
  * Be on time, or notify as early as possible about absence or lateness and offer something instead (here's my summary so you can read it). See Commitments, below.
  * _Everyone should share something. Prepare what you want to say (that fits the meeting agenda), and even send it to team members before the meeting._
  * If you have a proposal or idea, write it up in detail, and share it ahead of time. Indicate how it impacts something we care about (OKR).

## Commitments
  * Be clear and specific about commitments. Say "I'll send you a prototype link at 2pm" rather than "I'll be done after lunch". _This should be in writing, such as in a Trello ticket (in this case, set a deadline on the ticket too.)_
  * If you're not going to meet a commitment, tell the team as early as possible, and explain what the gap will be, and how close you are. Explain what else you can do to help.

## Every Day You Work
  * Share something with the team every day. The simplest way to do this is to report what you did on Slack in your team's channel, and anything you're stuck on. Shooting a quick [screen cap video]() to share is a great idea to try out.
  * Check slack twice a day at least, and react/respond to some other team members' posts.
  * Commit your code and push it to bitbucket every day.
  * Fill your timesheet (end of the day)
  * Check your company Email
## Every Week
  * Communicate with each client you are working with. Send them an update on what's done and what's pending out of their current expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)

## Do Not
  * Use priviate messages for things that don't need to be private. Share your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if it's more widely applicable, (#client-<your client slug>) in #general. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)
