User Stories
============

Purpose
-------

To describe the business goals of the project, and the features and
functionality its product must include to be considered "complete."

Scope
-----

Use the following process as a template for user stories documentation.

Process
-------

The User Stories document should be created after the process of
`Project Discovery <product/DISCOVERY.md>`__ has progressed to the stage
that we are discussing real, tangible possibilities for a project to
deliver.

"User Stories" should be readable by any project stakeholder of any
skill set, and they should be regularly updated accordingly when client
feedback or user testing leads to potential changes. If you are new to
this concept overall, the `User story
Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story>`__ provides some
great beginning resources.

Personas
--------

Who uses the product (software you are developing in the project)? List
them and determine their roles within context.

Epics
-----

Make a list of stories (in groups called Epics) that explain how the
user uses the product and why, i.e.:

(PERSONA) needs to (ACTION) so they can accomplish (GOAL).

User Acceptance Tests (UATs)
----------------------------

User Acceptance Tests, usually denoted in User Stories as UATs, comprise
a listing of the technical requirements that must be met within the
project to meet the User Story requirements. Generally, it's useful to
list all of these below the related Epics, and strikethrough tasks as
the team accomplishes them and they're approved by clients and project
leads.

"Detailed written requirements minimize the need for collaboration
within the team and actively prevent the customer requirements to emerge
during the development."
