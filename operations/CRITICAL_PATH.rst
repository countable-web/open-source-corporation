Critical Path
=============

Purpose
-------

Release a prototype as quickly as possible.

Scope
-----

Identify dependencies to complete a finished product, and make sure the
"critical path" these items define is minimized.

Process
-------

The "critical path" is the *longest* list of dependencies to completing
a project. To find this, work back from the goal.

For example, if the goal is to build a web applicaton, the critical path
is something like this:

-  We want to build a web application.
-  To do that, we need to validate with users (usability test).
-  To complete that, we need to understand the full requirements.
-  To do that, we need to show all stakeholders a prototype.
-  To do that, we need to build the prototype.
-  To do that, we need wireframes.
-  To do that, we need to write user stories.
-  To do that, we need to understand the purpose of the app.
-  To do that, we need to do discovery (user research).

So, to deliver the project as quickly as possible, all these steps
should be completed as early as possible because they block your team
mates. The time the project takes is the sum of all these critical path
steps. There is plenty of other work to be done, but typically other
items can be deferred and worked on asynchronously. The items on the
critical path are the bottlenecks.
