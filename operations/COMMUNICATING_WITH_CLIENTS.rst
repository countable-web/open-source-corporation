Communicating with Clients
==========================

Reporting on Work
-----------------

-  Use Trello for quick updates, mention all relevant parties so they
   get a notification.
-  Email may be appropriate as well for more substantial updates that
   deal with several Trello cards.
-  Show the clients you work for something at least once a week. You can
   use **Screencastify chrome extension** for it (`More
   details <../../peopleops/getting_started/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md>`__).
-  Keep it visual. Use screenshots, mockups, videos, and links to staged
   apps as the primary way to demonstrate work to clients.
-  Try to anticipate what problems they will have when using the app,
   and test the ways you expect them to use it in order to make a
   seamless experience.
-  When reporting on work to clients, re-state what your commitments
   were and how much is done.
-  Indicate anything that's currently overdue or other unmet
   commitsments as early as possible, indicate how you're fixing it.

General Client Communication Guidelines
---------------------------------------

-  If something's unclear to you, as very specific (not open ended)
   questions and state your assumptions so far so they can point out any
   miscommuniation.
-  Be *concise*. Most clients get a *lot* of email so stick to key
   points that will matter to them. Be respectful of their time, and
   avoid asking for something if you've not made an effort to solve it
   yourself.
-  Show appreciation for the client's time, and anything they've done to
   help the project along.
-  Send the communication to only the people who will find it relevant,
   and copy all team members who have been involved in the project.
