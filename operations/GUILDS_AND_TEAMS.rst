Purpose
-------
Define what guilds and teams exist (and don't exist) at Countable.

Scope
-----

Countable is divided into Teams and Guilds. The job of Guilds is to be really good at specific things, and the job of Teams is to get results for customers. This document lists our existing Guilds and Teams.

List of Guilds
--------------

-  `DevOps Guild <../devops/DEVOPS.rst>`__ - Their goal is to ensure our software is delivered to customers as quickly, reliably and automatically as possible.
-  `Developer Guild <../developers/DEVELOPERS.rst>`__ - Their goal is to improve our code, solve problems for users, and demonstrate working software to our team every day.
-  `User Experience Guild <../ux/UX.rst>`__ - Their goal is to help everyone, from users to product owners and developers, enjoy and benefit from interacting with our software.
-  `Operations Guild <OPERATIONS.rst>`__ - Their goal is maintaining clear and open communication with our clients, and maintaining the roadmap to sustainable growth for our firm.

Cross-Functional Teams
----------------------

We have cross-functional teams organized by Objective. For example, we have a ``bawkbox`` team whose top level objective is to make it easy for any website to install any 3rd party widget.

With each of our clients, we form a team with some of our staff. 

Countable does not have functional team divisions by job role.

Other Informal Groups
---------------------

On some occasions other groups may organize for professional development or other purposes. These are not ``teams`` in our company's terminology.
