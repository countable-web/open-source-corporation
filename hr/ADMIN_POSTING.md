If you love helping a team stay organized, online research, and are enthusiastic about communicating with a diverse set of stakeholders, let's chat!

`responsibilities and skills`

Help us stay organized and grow. You will be responsible for conducting market research, usability testing, admin stuff, and other activities to support our team of consultants. You'll attend weekly video team Scrum meetings and talk about the details of what you did each week. For this reason, it's required that we have a single person for consistency, not a changing team.

You must be:
1. A good writer (in English)
2. Good with Excel / Google Docs
3. Great at paying to detail while always trying to understand and work towards high level goals.
4. A self-starter who takes initiative to solve problems and chase opportunities for the company.

`test`

Complete some research on embeddable web based widgets and components. Install 5 on one page using squarespace. Fill a usability report and spreadsheet.
